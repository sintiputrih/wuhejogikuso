Know her Personal Life</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>If you are a fan of NFL (National Football League) player, <strong>Derek Carr</strong>, then you might know about his wife, <strong>Heather Neel. </strong>Before gaining fame, she worked as a waitress back in her college days. She gathered the limelight of her life after marrying NFL star who played as a quarterback for the <i>Oakland Raiders</i>.</p><p>The celebrity wife, Heather, was born on 3 January 1990, in Northern California, the USA, under the birth sign, Capricorn. Likewise, her ethnicity is white, and her nationality is American. Currently, she is thirty-years-old. If you are interested to know more about the married life of Heather, then read the article until the end.</p><h2>Married Life With Derek Carr</h2><p>Heather is currently a married woman as she is happily living with her long-time boyfriend. The wonderful duo walked down the aisle on 29 June 2012; the reverend pronounced them as husband and wife in front of their close friends and families.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/30/derek%20heather-1565265082080%20(1)-1577695160529.jpg><p>Well, the two first met at a BJ's Brewhouse, where she used to work as a waitress. At that time, she was working there to support herself in her studies. While working, she met Carr, who was a customer at that time. Within a couple of meeting the duo started dating each other and rest is history.</p><p>As of now, the couple is living happily without divorce rumors and controversies regarding their love life. It has been seven years of their successful marriage, and the couple is now proud parents of three.</p><h2>From Weird Pick Up Line To Married Couple</h2><p>On their first meeting, Carr asked her why she only had one earring on even though she has two on. She checked her ear quickly and realized two of them on her ear. At that time, Derek was picking her up, and she was like, "that's your pick up line?"</p><p>Heather shared her precious story in an interview with <i>ABC7</i>. Fortunately, the pickup line worked, and the pair started talking and eventually fell in love and wedded. Besides, she is also the one who changed partying Derek to decent Derek.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/30/6e974161c5cce7120bac745c9c45ef92-1577695250113.jpg><p>When the two were in a relationship, Derek was a partying guy and often went to the party, which she does not like. Later, she wrote a letter to him, which said that Derek presented himself differently from real Derek. So, if he wanted her to stay, then he had to fix that immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with Los Angeles Times, Carr said,</p><p>"Heather wrote me a letter, and she said, 'You're not the person that I thought you were.' I read that, and I remember I stood up in front of my teammates, and I told them, 'Hey, I've been telling you I'm a Christian, and I've been living the party life and all that. And that's dead wrong.' And that's kind of when I got my thing right,"</p><p>For now, he left his bad habits, as Heather said, and now they are in a happy relationship.</p><h2>Shares Three Kids From Their Marital Life</h2><p>They are enjoying their 7th anniversary and also loving their parenthood as they are the parents of their three children. They welcomed their first child, a son named <strong>Dallas Carr, </strong>on<i> </i>5 August 2013, who is currently six years old.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/30/73480781_107075000598809_5276177576073393566_n%20(1)-1577695399412.jpg><p>Unfortunately, he was born with tied up intestines, which took three medical <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>surgery</strong></a> to get it correct. Heather gave birth to their second child, a son named <strong>Deker Luke</strong>, on 16 March 2016, and he is three years old as of now.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, the lovely couple welcomed the third member in their family, whom they named <strong>Deakon Derek Carr</strong>.
