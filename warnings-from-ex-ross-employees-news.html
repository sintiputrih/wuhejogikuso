Maxx Employees</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/shutterstock_2163382899.jpg><p>It's hard to buy clothing without trying it on first, but if you're doing so at Ross, you may want to suds up when you get home.</p><p>"I think you should shower after trying on clothes at any fitting room. Bed bugs and lice are very common. I used to work at Ross. Those <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>clothes are never cleaned</a>," claims ex-employee Alpha8472 on Retail Watchers.</p><p>Another former employee doubled down on this claim in the comments section of a TikTok video, saying, "I used to work at Ross and <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>everything is Unsanitary</a>!" The poster of the video added, "I worked at 2 Rosses & they both had problems with mice."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/shutterstock_1836023077.jpg><p>If you're looking at items in the jewelry case, be aware that you can only try on one piece at a time.</p><p>"Once upon a time I worked at Ross Dress for Less <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>and I was a cashier</a>, so I worked up at the front," @sarahhryniewicz said in a TikTok video. A customer she was helping asked to see two pieces of jewelry at once, and she explained, "I can only take out one at a time." After arguing, the customer complained to corporate.</p><p>It may be frustrating not being able to compare necklaces against each other, but the policy is likely in place because&nbsp;the store has experienced a shoplifting problem and even <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>has a loss prevention team</a> to catch people stealing.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>6 Warnings to Shoppers From Ex-Kohl's Employees</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/shutterstock_1860894217.jpg><p>At any discount store, things tend to get disorganized faster. After all, there are items from so many different brands, and the inventory gets turned over quickly. This certainly seems to be the case at Ross.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>"I worked at Ross for about a week before I couldn't handle it anymore… Managers would tell me, 'don't worry too much about folding or organizing, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>just get stuff off the floor</a>,'" MundaneNhilist wrote on Reddit. Another commenter added, "Any holiday was 10 times worse."</p><p>In a separate Reddit thread, yet another former employee joked, "I <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>used to work at Ross</a>…I called it Ross Mess for Less instead of Dress for Less!" Both employees and shoppers agree that the store is often completely disorganized, especially at closing time, which is another helpful reminder. Make sure to put things away where you found them so you don't leave employees even more work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/shutterstock_1860902533.jpg><p>If a store is busy, you may have to wait for an employee to ring up your purchases if they're busy cleaning up the store.</p><p>"When I worked at Ross it was <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>a very stressful environment</a> and they were always shorted staff," a former California sales associate wrote on the employment site Simply Hired. "It felt like it was always disorganized since they have you run around cleaning the aisles and call you to the cashier to ring customers up."</p><p>Likewise, a former Ohio employee said on Indeed that "corporate only cares about pushing more and more product out and does not care about employees or store management. the store has been <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>severely understaffed</a> for almost a year."</p><p><strong>For more shopping advice delivered straight to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/shutterstock_2086175332.jpg><p>On Tuesdays, Ross offers a 10 percent senior discount for shoppers 55 and older. In the comments section of a TikTik video about working at the store on this day, an employee said, "we literally have to assume or <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>ask if they're 55 or older</a>." Another employee added, "they say just add it if they look old but then they're like oh I look old and I'm just like ummm."</p><p>Bottom line: If you're under 55 and are given the senior discount, don't be offended. Employees are likely erring on the side of caution, so just appreciate the money you're saving.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmsJmio7avs9JmnaunnWKyuXnRqKqsZZWiva272J6crGWemsS0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
