For a sexy-history show there wasn’t a lot, and I was getting&nbsp;anxious. But if you wanted to watch an early 17th-century king get railed by a series of handsome young men, wow, what a show this has turned out to be for you.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv627vuz000v3b7z20trrqsi@published data-word-count=129>Mary experiences a teenage nightmare when she walks into King James’s court and everyone turns to look at her and then starts talking about how&nbsp;terribly&nbsp;she’s dressed and how&nbsp;bad&nbsp;her makeup is. Or! Does she look terrible on purpose? Francis Bacon prompts questions. Also, Francis Bacon is there now! He is our mystery man from last week,&nbsp;the one&nbsp;who got Sir David’s information about Mary’s dirty peasant past after Sir David&nbsp;was murdered. It’s fun to learn that&nbsp;<a href=# class=editor-rtfLink>the man who was responsible</a>&nbsp;for my having to slog through science labs in high school was&nbsp;<a href=# class=editor-rtfLink>probably gay</a>.&nbsp;Makes&nbsp;it slightly more tolerable in retrospect. And did you know Bacon courted Lady Hatton before she rejected him in favor of Edward Coke? Everyone’s all tangled up together on this show, literally and metaphorically (literally because of sex, you see).</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv627vy7000w3b7zoahcyvib@published data-word-count=95>So why is Mary at court, what’s going on with George, and what’s that weird wax carving at the top of the episode? Is the director waving that Artemisia Gentileschi painting under our noses too much or just enough that I finally go “Ohhhhhhhh”? Well. After last week, when George sexily banged King James, we now find George relegated to orgy musician while Somerset asserts his dominance over James. Very few people&nbsp;are going to&nbsp;care if George is playing a cello or a viol, but I’m 80 percent certain it’s a viol with a cello soundtrack.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv627w12000x3b7z514wadqz@published data-word-count=94>Mary knows&nbsp;about George’s difficulty in&nbsp;seeing the king, so she goes to court. She has Sandie do her makeup, which looks Elizabethan in the wrong way, and apparently, her dress is&nbsp;bad?&nbsp;We know this because everyone says it’s&nbsp;bad, including the king.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is why it’s important to remember that fashion is never a decadeslong monolith,&nbsp;and&nbsp;it&nbsp;changes frequently, especially back in the day at court.&nbsp;I have no idea about Jacobean fashion,&nbsp;though, so let’s all&nbsp;just&nbsp;trust that Mary’s dress is terrible, presumably because it’s outdated.&nbsp;Later, she wears a dress that seems much more acceptable to the court, and I&nbsp;absolutely&nbsp;cannot tell the difference.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv627w3o000y3b7ztv8n3y02@published data-word-count=73>George, pouting by the fire, asks Mary what happened to Sir David. She tells him not to worry about it. If I murdered someone, I also wouldn’t tell George. The next time he got upset with you because you wouldn’t listen to his sonnet, he’d end up telling the first sympathetic person he encountered that you had done a murder, and then you’d be arrested, all because George was butt-hurt about his poetry.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv627w6m000z3b7zlj420ton@published data-word-count=63>Somerset and his wife Frances fake-kill James with a viol bow, and everyone at court thinks it’s hilarious, including James. The Somersets are the worst. They’re the people at a party who have to have fun as loudly as possible so everyone knows how much fun they are&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;having.&nbsp;I&nbsp;do&nbsp;still like Somerset’s whole look, though, with his little beard and&nbsp;his&nbsp;earring, like a piratical fancy man.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv627w9p00103b7zkyd8dj9c@published data-word-count=78>Amidst this, Mary approaches James and mentions how poorly he’s being treated by the Somersets.&nbsp;Then she tries to jump on Lady Hatton and has to be escorted out so she can “strategically vomit” from being drunk. Again, this seems terrible, but it is maybe all on&nbsp;purpose?&nbsp;Perhaps the vomit is strategic not because of where it lands but because it’s happening at all. I don’t know. Mary is playing 4-D chess, and I am furrowing my brow at Candyland.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv627wd100113b7zqokpuih2@published data-word-count=92>Frances, Countess of Somerset, had a previous husband, but&nbsp;she had their marriage&nbsp;annulled on the grounds of impotence. This man, the Earl of Essex, visits Mary to warn her not to get in Frances’s way. He claims he is only impotent because Frances used a spell. He also tells her that the Somersets murdered a man named Sir Thomas Overbury.&nbsp;<a href=# class=editor-rtfLink>Historically</a>, this seems to be because Sir Thomas tried to stand in the way of the Somersets’ marriage, encouraging Somerset not to marry Frances. I would also tell my friend not to marry Frances.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv627wfq00123b7zzgr0r47r@published data-word-count=70>George meets Francis Bacon in a brothel, and Francis encourages George to stand up to Somerset.&nbsp;This&nbsp;seems like a terrible idea. George then has sex with a male sex worker and gets smallpox. Damnit, George. He tries to stand up to the Somersets in front of the king, but he is&nbsp;literally&nbsp;already sweating from this highly feared disease, and he passes out. The Somersets make fun of him because they’re the worst.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv627wmq00133b7zbiy1ehxy@published data-word-count=96>As George is vaguely trying to accomplish one (1) thing, Mary is locating a witch, threatening her, and obtaining evidence from her to convict the Somersets of murder. Moms, am I right?&nbsp;This&nbsp;is all part of Mary’s&nbsp;plan,&nbsp;the final step of which is her son becoming the king’s primary sex partner. What a strange family. We see a montage of all the Somersets’ accomplices being tried, convicted, and hanged. Frances’s maid, Miss Turner, is hanged! I was so surprised! Also, this all&nbsp;really&nbsp;happened! This show is shockingly faithful to historical events while maintaining its Starz-required sexiness. I’m very impressed.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv627wrg00143b7zaovownry@published data-word-count=101>Somerset panics and goes to a still-very-ill George’s bedside to plead with him to intervene with James. He pulls the unbelievable move of telling George that Somerset wasn’t trying to keep him away from James; he was trying to keep James away from George because, in fact,&nbsp;Somerset is in love with George. Amazing.&nbsp;Complete&nbsp;and utter garbage, but he tries it. Then they bang in front of the fire. George still has smallpox, but okay! The banging scene is&nbsp;very good&nbsp;but too short, and at the end, George&nbsp;basically&nbsp;says, I’m not interceding with the king; I just wanted, like my mother, to fuck you. Hey-oooo!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv627wxm00153b7zbyst5ird@published data-word-count=113>The Somersets are on trial, and the weird wax figure&nbsp;being&nbsp;carved&nbsp;at the start of the episode is a poppet that Frances commissioned from the witch. Frances is found guilty! Somerset is found guilty! Frances is&nbsp;extremely&nbsp;pregnant, so this is very stressful, even though she is, as mentioned, the worst. In jail later,&nbsp;she&nbsp;delivers the baby, and they immediately take it away. As the parent of a tiny baby, this was very upsetting to watch (maybe also for non-parents? I have no memory of the before times), so be aware that this baby is&nbsp;<a href=# class=editor-rtfLink>Anne Russell, Countess of Bedford</a>, and she is going to be&nbsp;fine&nbsp;and live until she’s 68.&nbsp;(Please exercise caution in clicking that link, which contains&nbsp;historical spoilers.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv627x0y00163b7z9o9m0g5t@published data-word-count=113>Mary&nbsp;comes back&nbsp;to court looking&nbsp;amazing, and everyone is like,&nbsp;wow, what a transformation. Mary’s so powerful —&nbsp;she&nbsp;<a href=#>She’s&nbsp;All That</a>’d herself.&nbsp;James comes up to her&nbsp;and asks&nbsp;if&nbsp;she&nbsp;can ever forgive him, and says they&nbsp;are both people who&nbsp;survive.&nbsp;She leads him&nbsp;over&nbsp;to George, whose viol/cello plays over a montage of his new status as&nbsp;primary&nbsp;king’s&nbsp;fancy man.&nbsp;We see the&nbsp;aforementioned Gentileschi&nbsp;painting again,&nbsp;<a href=#>Judith Beheading Holofernes</a>, which also&nbsp;features&nbsp;in the opening credits.&nbsp;For those&nbsp;not familiar&nbsp;with Italian art history (or Tumblr), this is a&nbsp;contemporaneous&nbsp;painting by a&nbsp;<a href=#>woman artist</a>&nbsp;depicting the biblical (depending on your Bible) character Judith, who entered an Assyrian general’s tent and cut off his head.&nbsp;It’s very much Mary taking control and ending the Somerset reign. I love that&nbsp;it was painted&nbsp;at the same time as these events! That’s so neat!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv627x4f00173b7zus33gzr4@published data-word-count=49>Francis Bacon accosts Mary and tells her he thinks her disastrous display at court was deliberate because James loves an underdog. Mary says she has never acted a day in her life. They both low-key threaten each other and then sit back and watch George play his undetermined instrument.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv627xfg00183b7z4s9pocoz@published data-word-count=38>So now George is on top! Again, both literally and figuratively. I’m hoping for&nbsp;fancy man&nbsp;clothes, more single-ear pirate earrings,&nbsp;longer&nbsp;sex scenes, and more kissing between Mary and Sandie. Let’s just gay up everyone; Pride Month is only,&nbsp;like,&nbsp;a month away.</p><h3 class=title>VULTURE NEWSLETTER</h3>Keep up with all the drama of your favorite shows!
