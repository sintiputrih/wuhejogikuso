A black baseball cap covered his face. Both Kourtney, 45, and Disick, 40, dropped “likes” on the post as did his aunts <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>, <strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong> and <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong>.</p><p class=p1>Both Kim, 43, and Khloé, 39, were in disbelief that their eldest nephew had joined the social media platform.</p><p class=p1>“You’re really on Instagram,” Kim marveled in her Instagram reply.</p><p class=p1>Khloé also commented on Mason’s social media debut. “I can’t believe my @masondisick is on Insta,” she wrote via Instagram Stories, resharing Mason’s initial post. “The one who named [Kim and I] Kiki and Koko is a legit teenager.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Kourtney-Kardashian-and-Scott-Disicks-Son-Mason-14-Is-All-Grown-Up-in-His-1st-Instagram-Photos.jpg><p class=p1>In follow-up posts on his account, Mason shared additional snaps with his “fam” of friends and his siblings, Penelope and Reign.

(Barker, 48, also shares three kids with ex-wife Shanna Moakler.)</p><p class=p1>While much of Mason’s childhood was featured on <i>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</i>, he’s sought a more private life as he entered his teenage phase. Disick did give a rare update on Mason during<a href=#> the season 5 premiere</a> of Hulu’s <i>The Kardashians.</i></p><p class=p1>“He’s great, he’s really been unbelievable,” Disick told Kourtney’s mother,<strong> Kris Jenner</strong>, in an episode that dropped earlier this week. “We’re closer than ever. He’s extremely excited about that new car you promised him in three years.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Kris, 68, had previously promised to buy Mason, her oldest grandchild, a car when he turns 16 and passes his driving test.</p><p class=p1>“[I told him] on his bar mitzvah that I would buy him a car when he was 16 if I felt really confident and I could have proof that he’s never done any drugs or alcohol or anything like that,” Kris said during an April episode of the “Next Question With Katie Couric” podcast. “And then yeah, what happens is my kids kept, you know, keep having kids. So now I have a feeling I’m going to be kind of on the hook for 13 cars.”</p><p class=p3>In addition to Kourtney’s four kids, Kris is also “Lovey” — <a href=#>her grandparent nickname</a> — to Khloé, Kim, Kylie and <strong>Rob Kardashian</strong>’s respective little ones.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGakp6Wnwa%2Bx2GaimqqUlsCptcCnZJqmlGLApLvTrWSdoaOesKy%2FjKymp2WdlsCwuoyjpqKmo2K2r7%2FTmp6rmZ1k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
