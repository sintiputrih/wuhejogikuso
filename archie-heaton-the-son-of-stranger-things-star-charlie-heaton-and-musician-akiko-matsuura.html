For example, in an interview with GQ magazine, Charlie said that being a father at a young age was “incredible” and that Archie was “the best thing that ever happened” to him. He also said that he wanted to give Archie a “stable” and “normal” life.</p><p>Charlie also faced some challenges as a father, especially when he was denied entry to the US in 2017 after a small amount of cocaine was found in his luggage at the airport. This incident prevented him from attending the premiere of the second season of Stranger Things and caused him to miss some time with his son. However, he later apologized for the incident and said that it was a “mistake” and that he had learned from it.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Archie’s Mother: Akiko Matsuura</strong></h3><p>Akiko Matsuura is a talented musician who was born in Japan and moved to London when she was 18 years old.
