She felt [betrayed]… she felt like she was going to have a relationship and this happened and she was mad," he says.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: See scandalous snaps of Michelle</a></p><p>A source tells the <a href=#>new issue of Us Weekly</a>, on stands now, that Michelle was paid $30,000 to sell her story shortly after.</p><p>Since then, "I don't think she's had contact with Jesse James," Denny says. "I don't think they're on speaking terms right now."</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Sandy and her 6-year-old stepdaughter, Sunny</a></p><p>Michelle "doesn't really bring up Sandra Bullock's name," continues Denny. "She's more or less taking up her own business right now, and she's not really concerned about Jesse and Sandra right now."</p><p>An insider told <strong>Us</strong> that James "ruined" Bullock's life with news of the affair. How's Michelle coping?</p><p>"She's doing great," her dad says. "She's in seclusion right now. I'm all concerned… she's cool with it, [saying], 'We're gonna make it through this good.'"</p><p>If given the opportunity to speak to James, Denny says, "I wouldn't want to say anything to him. I don't have anything against Jesse personally. He's a hardworking guy who built up his business. I just wish he'd been honest with my daughter from the beginning so this never would have happened."</p><p>He says his daughter is not a homewrecker.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: The post-Oscar split curse</a></p><p>"The truth of the matter is, going into this whole thing with Jesse James, Michelle was single, and she was under the assumption that Jesse was single. As far as I'm concerned, they were two single people going out with each other, and there's nothing wrong with that," he says.</p><p>Denny also claims Michelle — who was photographed in Nazi paraphernalia — is not anti-semitic. "She's always been a great kid and a good mom to her kids," he says of her children, Elijah, 11, and Avery, 5. "She's just a little bit different with the tattoos and stuff."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamoZOdsq24xGaknJ%2BVmsBusMCdZJ2dlpq7pb%2BMoZyrZZakv26ty6WcoJ2UYremv9KeZKOZnZrAbq3Fn5iiql1nfXJ8kXBqaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
