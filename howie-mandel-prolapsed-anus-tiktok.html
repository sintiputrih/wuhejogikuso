"Does somebody know, is this COVID related? And if it is, what do we do about it?"</p><p>The since-deleted video was up for several hours before it was removed, and reportedly racked up nearly 3 million views, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight Canada</a>. Many TikTok users took the opportunity to record the clip and add themselves via greenscreen, then repost the video to their pages while obstructing the offending body part.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Unsurprisingly, every since TikTok caught wind of the video taking on a life of its own, it's attempted to delete and/or block the users who have been trying to continue the video's circulation.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Naturally, those who weren't able to see the video while it was still up have taken to search all over the internet to try and locate the disturbing clip. While YouTube seems to also have scrubbed the most disturbing still of the video — that is, the one of the actual prolapsed rectum — some Twitter users have had more success in adding the clip to their pages.</p><p>As of this July 11 writing, the video is available to watch by searching Twitter for the hashtag "#howiemandel" and accepting to view what the platform calls "potentially sensitive content."
