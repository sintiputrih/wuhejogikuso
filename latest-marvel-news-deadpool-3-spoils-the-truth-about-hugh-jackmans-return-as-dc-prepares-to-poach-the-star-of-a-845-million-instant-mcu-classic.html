And the proof is already here…</p><h2 id=h-new-deadpool-3-synopsis-confirms-wade-and-wolverine-are-about-to-tear-up-the-mcu data-injectable=false>New Deadpool 3 synopsis confirms Wade and Wolverine are about to tear up the MCU</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hugh-Jackman-Wolverine-Deadpool-3.jpg><p data-characters=635 data-current-count=635 data-injectable=true>You’d better believe Deadpool 3 is going to be Marvel’s first R-rated movie — even its synopses are for mature eyes only. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A new Japanese plot summary</a> for the threequel deploys the shocking bombshell that it will see the “f***ing irresponsible hero Deadpool change the history of the MCU with Wolverine.” Excuse me, he’ll what now? Does Kevin Feige know about this? If Deadpool 3 repeats the ending of The Flash and has George Clooney turn up as Iron Man in the final frame, it had better make all the money. If anyone can erase Marvel’s box office troubles from the timeline, it’s Deadpool.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Captain America: Brave New World‘s new suit for Sam Cap gives up its secrets too soon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Sam-Wilson-Captain-America-Avengers.jpg><p data-characters=634 data-current-count=934 data-injectable=true>Ah, merch: both Marvel’s greatest money-maker and its biggest bane. Thanks to a rogue snap that’s made its way online, we’ve now got <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">our first look at the new superhero suit</a> worn by Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson in Captain America: Brave New World. As you’d expect, reactions are split down the middle, like Steve Rogers’ shield after Thanos had a go at it. Partly that’s because Sam only got to wear his last one for just five minutes at the end of Falcon and the Winter Soldier and we all liked it. Sure, it’s a brave new world but we would’ve been fine with a familiar old suit.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Guardians 3‘s James Gunn and Zoe Saldaña seem all but confirmed to reunite in the DCU</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Zoe-Saldana-DC-Universe.jpg><p data-characters=776 data-current-count=1076 data-injectable=false>The one shining light of Marvel’s misshapen 2023 was Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, which earned a whopping $845 million at the box office. The only problem is that writer/director James Gunn has since hopped to DC, and it looks like he’s taking his Guardians with him. Gamora herself Zoe Saldaña has admitted <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she would love to work with Gunn again</a> on a new superhero project, while Gunn has similarly admitted that he’s already got some roles for her in mind. Add in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean “Kraglin” Gunn playing Maxwell Lord</a> and persistent rumors <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Pratt could be Booster Gold</a>, and it seems likely that the entire Guardians team could reassemble one day… Just not in the MCU. Oh well, if it does happen, blame Deadpool for messing with the timeline.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoo5qslajBbrnAq62epF2jsri%2FjJ2cmpygpLyteZJmqqmnmaHAbsDHnmStqqWptW6twaisrWWYqrSpecmamqSlkaPAbr7Erayrpl2WwG6wwmanq52glr%2Bmv4ytpmaon5awqXnToZxmq6SWv267xWaYZnBkanqutculoKimXZ67tMDAp6tmpZOqeqS4wKyqoptf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
