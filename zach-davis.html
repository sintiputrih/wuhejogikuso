And now that the baby is on the way, Cheyenne and Zach say they want to do more than work this time. According to what she revealed, the two gradually reconnected after Zach slid into her DM. There was a lot of talking over food, and they eventually made a promise to themselves to make it until forever “this time.”</p><p>Because the Ex on the Beach star wrote on Instagram, “This year you become a father and I am honored to carry your son,” it’s safe to assume they’re expecting a son. Not only that. Ace Harold will be the name of the boy.</p><p>Baby Ace will be reunited with his half-sister Ryder (born on April 7, 2017). Cheyenne is co-parenting Ryder with her ex-boyfriend and co-parenting partner Cory Wharton. And every now and then, she thanks her new partner Zach for being so wonderful with Ryder.</p><p>Zach proposed to Cheyenne during their baby shower in April 2021. He shared the happy news with his Instagram followers, writing, “She said yes! Put a ring on both of their middle fingers!
