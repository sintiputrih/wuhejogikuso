And by “beginning,” we mean “learning the difference between onions, garlic, and shallots.” Mars was breaking her parents’ biggest rule (no public social media) because she was already grounded. “Make a vodka sauce pasta with me because I’m grounded,” she says in the now-deleted TikTok, “because I tried to charter a helicopter from New York to Maryland on my dad’s credit card, because I wanted to have dinner with my camp friend.” Just an insane string of words right there. But what the terminally online might not know is that vodka sauce was not a random choice by Mars. It’s a sauce that already has deep roots in celebrity culture, and <a href=#>nepo-baby</a> culture, for that matter.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clflj4n21001a3b6v4cn943ui@published data-word-count=111>Vodka sauce is having 15 minutes of fame (or rather, a second 15 minutes) thanks in part to Gigi Hadid. Hadid, daughter of former Real Housewife of Beverly Hills Yolanda Hadid and sister of <a href=#>deviled-egg enthusiast</a> Bella Hadid, first made her variation of spicy vodka sauce on Instagram <a href=#>back in 2020</a>. She omitted the vodka, since she was pregnant at the time. People trying the “Gigi Hadid pasta” ran rampant on FoodTok. And it had a <a href=#>recent resurgence</a>, with a weird self-awareness tinge. <a href=#>Multiple</a> <a href=#>videos</a> are captioned something along the lines of “<a href=#>POV it’s 2023 and you’re still making the Gigi Hadid pasta</a>,” with one even calling the dish “<a href=#>Quarantine nostalgia.</a>”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clfljp7y9001h3b6vxzbgassw@published data-word-count=139>But the pasta itself has even deeper celeb-foodie roots. Hadid’s spicy vodka sauce may have its origins at notorious red-sauce joint Carbone, a restaurant known for its <a href=#>spicy rigatoni alla vodka</a>. The Hadid sisters are regular patrons, as are <a href=#>the Kardashians</a>. And Carbone was notoriously the site of one of Ye and Julia Fox’s dates during <a href=#>that whole … thing</a>. “At the restaurant, Ye directed an entire photo shoot for me while people dined!” Fox wrote in <a href=#>Interview</a> at the time. “The whole restaurant loved it and cheered us on while it was happening.” Fox and Ye actually dined at <a href=#>two of Carbone’s locations</a>, Miami and New York, during their brief fling. Carbone does not, however, have a Maryland location. So who knows where Romy and her camp friend were going to eat, had that helicopter charter worked out.</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clen3zbvl00000pa2noxbl6mz@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Let’s Do the Thing: How Online Were You in February 2023?</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clesqjuic002n0iglaxudc4yo@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>TikTok’s Favorite Celebrity Couple Is Kim Kardashian and Michael Cera</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl9irk1n80000o3f0ub6gpn1j@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>There’s a New Taylor Swift–Inspired Cookie Recipe for Midnights</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Unpacking the Deep Pasta Lore in Romy Mars’s TikTok</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdgaHy0u8WimGabn6W9sLjArGSdmaWctbWx0axkraGbqbysedWom6SZXaiutq%2FEZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
