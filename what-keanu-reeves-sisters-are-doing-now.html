Speaking to The Mirror (via <a href=#>Whoa Is (Not) Me</a>) in 2003, Emma Rose explained, "I would love to have a relationship with Keanu," adding, "I don't want anything from him — not money, not fame by association — just to get to know my big brother.

According to The Victor O'Hana Facebook page (via <a href=#>Mr.-Reeves.com</a>), Emma Rose hosted a memorial luncheon in light of Samuel Reeves' passing, but none of her father's other children were in attendance.</p><p>If you were shocked to learn that Reeves has multiple siblings, you'll never believe <a href=#>what else you don't know about the actor's life</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam9pZYJ3e9ahmK1lm5qur8GMq5yerpWoerS10q2cq6tdlr%2BmecOooKefXaO8uHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
