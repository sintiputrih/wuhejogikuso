So don’t tell me things like, ‘Just do what we say, don’t question it. When have we ever been wrong?’ A lot.”</p><p>“All the time!” added Rogan, echoing his guest.</p><p>Back in January, an open letter, inspired by a particularly egregious New Year’s Eve episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience,” was<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> published online</a> and signed by hundreds of medical experts decrying Spotify for disseminating Rogan’s dangerous “misinformation.”</p><p>The letter subsequently prompted a high-profile <a href=#>boycott of the streaming platform</a> by musicians including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/rogan-maher-vaccine-index.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Joe-Rogan-Bill-Maher-Twitter_01.jpeg><p>Their accord may come as no surprise amid Rogan’s media portrayal <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as an agent of “misinformation”</a>; Maher, meanwhile, has steadily alienated himself <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">from the liberal audiences</a> who once counted on “Real Time” as a voice of reason. On his show earlier this year, the 65-year-old former comedian slammed the “medical-industrial complex” for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spreading “misinformation”</a> about COVID-19 during the early days of the pandemic, when little was understood about the novel coronavirus.</p><p>In this week’s conversation with Rogan, Maher also pretended to be a healthcare expert, mockingly saying: “‘We are perfectly certain that this vaccine is safe!’ You don’t f – – king know that!”</p><p>Rogan built on Maher’s point, noting that pharmaceutical companies that manufacture vaccines bring in an “insane” payoff. He also suggested there is less thorough testing on drugs than some have received in the past.</p><p>“They’ve taken&nbsp;hundreds&nbsp;of drugs off the market,” Maher said.</p><p>“All the time,” Rogan responded. “They do it every year.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7j21mamtfn7ymedGonpqmXZe2rbiMppihnaJiwbOt0qFkm6GXYr2prdGmmGaukZiwqrrErGSdp56perW%2B1KyrZqyYmrpw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
