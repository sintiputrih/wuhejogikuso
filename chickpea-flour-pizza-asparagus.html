But when I follow it with “gluten free pizza night!,” he knows that he’s about to work with overly sticky dough that he can’t toss in the air.</p><p>Air-tossing aside, this chickpea flour dough was easy to work with, and we both enjoyed making (and eating) this pizza, which comes from the book <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chickpea Flour Does it All</a>, by Lindsey Love. Lindsey is also the creator of one of my absolute favorite food blogs – <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dolly and Oatmeal. </a>I’m sure many of you are fans of hers as well. If you’re not, go check out her site! It’s jaw-droppingly gorgeous, and it’s full of gluten-free and dairy-free recipes.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/chickpea-flour-pizza-asparagus/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2016_04_04_07435.jpg&description=The+BEST+gluten-free+pizza+crust+recipe%2C+this+chickpea+flour+crust+is+light+%26+healthy%2C+with+more+protein+than+your+average+crust.+Load+it+with+your+favorite+pizza+toppings%2C+or+use+this+beautiful+hummus+%26+asparagus+combo.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons+%23pizza+%23glutenfree+%23vegan")'></span></span><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/chickpea-flour-pizza-asparagus/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2016_04_04_07448.jpg&description=The+BEST+gluten-free+pizza+crust+recipe%2C+this+chickpea+flour+crust+is+light+%26+healthy%2C+with+more+protein+than+your+average+crust.+Load+it+with+your+favorite+pizza+toppings%2C+or+use+this+beautiful+hummus+%26+asparagus+combo.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons+%23pizza+%23glutenfree+%23vegan")'></span></span></p><p>But this book – it’s&nbsp;so good! I don’t have very much experience cooking with chickpea flour, but I’m inspired to use it more since it’s so nutritious. I also made her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lavender Vanilla Cupcakes</a> and was blown away by how good they were. I actually made them twice because the first batch disappeared too quickly.</p><p>This dough recipe requires a few extra ingredients that you might not have on hand, but once I had them all, I could easily make the rest of the recipes in the book.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/chickpea-flour-pizza-asparagus/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2016_04_04_07443.jpg&description=The+BEST+gluten-free+pizza+crust+recipe%2C+this+chickpea+flour+crust+is+light+%26+healthy%2C+with+more+protein+than+your+average+crust.+Load+it+with+your+favorite+pizza+toppings%2C+or+use+this+beautiful+hummus+%26+asparagus+combo.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons+%23pizza+%23glutenfree+%23vegan")'></span></span></p><p>This chickpea flour pizza crust would be delicious with regular pizza toppings – sauce, cheese, or vegan cheese, but I followed Lindsey’s cue&nbsp;and made this light &&nbsp;lovely salad pizza. I couldn’t find green asparagus, so I used white. And her recipe calls for pea shoots, which I couldn’t find, so I used arugula.</p><p>This recipe made two medium sized chickpea flour pizzas, which was enough for us for two dinners. We made the dough, baked&nbsp;half of it&nbsp;one night, and the other half the next night. Lindsay notes that the crust also freezes well, so check out the recipe notes for her suggestions.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Oh, and go get her book!

Make a well in the center of the bowl and add the yeast mixture and oil. Using a dough hook on an electric mixer or a paddle attachment on a stand mixer, mix the dough until smooth. Dough should be able to hold its form but be sticky to the touch. If the dough is too sticky and not able to hold its form, add more chickpea flour 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough is firmer. Cover the dough in the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and allow dough to rise in a warm place for 30 to 45 minutes, until roughly doubled in size.</li><li class=instruction itemprop=recipeInstructions>Place a wire rack at the lowest position in your oven, place a baking stone or baking sheet on it, and preheat oven to 500°F (260°C).</li><li class=instruction itemprop=recipeInstructions>Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and lightly dust them with sorghum flour. Using a dough scraper, divide the dough into two even pieces; gently form each piece of dough into a ball. Place a piece of dough on each prepared piece of parchment; dust the dough with a light coating of flour and press it into an 11-inch round, working your fingers from the inside of the dough to the outside until the crust is about ¼ inch thick, dusting with more flour as needed.</li><li class=instruction itemprop=recipeInstructions>Cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise once more for 15 to 20 minutes; dough should puff up slightly and be springy to the touch.</li><li class=instruction itemprop=recipeInstructions>While the dough is rising again, prepare the toppings. In a large bowl, combine the asparagus, capers, 2 teaspoons of oil, and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice; season with salt and pepper. In a separate bowl, combine the pea shoots with the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil and ó teaspoon lemon juice; season with salt and pepper; set aside.</li><li class=instruction itemprop=recipeInstructions>Use a pizza peel or cookie sheet to gently slide one piece of parchment with the dough onto the baking stone and bake for 5 minutes, until the dough is slightly golden and a bit stiff. Use the peel to slide the dough out of the oven, and spread half the hummus over top of the pizza; then distribute half the asparagus and capers over the hummus; place back in the oven and bake until the edges are lightly browned and crisp and asparagus is lightly charred in places, about 8 to 10 minutes.</li><li class=instruction itemprop=recipeInstructions>Remove the pizza from the oven and top with pea shoots. Let the pizza rest for 5 minutes to let the pea shoots wilt a bit. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li><li class=instruction itemprop=recipeInstructions>Repeat with remaining dough and toppings.</li>Notes*Note: Pizza dough can be stored in the freezer for up to 1 month. To thaw, remove from the freezer the morning of, or at least 5 hours before cooking, and allow the dough to come to room temperature. If not using the dough right away, store in the refrigerator until ready. Prepare the dough as directed.<p>Recipe from <a href=#>Chickpea Flour Does It All: Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free, Vegetarian Recipes for Every Taste and Season</a> © Lindsey S. Love, 2016.
