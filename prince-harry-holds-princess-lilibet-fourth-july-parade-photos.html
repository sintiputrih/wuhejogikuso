While at the parade, Prince Harry rocked a casual, yet dapper, ensemble that featured a green button-up shirt and blue denim trousers. He added a matching green hat and sunglasses as his accessories of choice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/prince-harry-lilibet-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>While Lilibet was being held by her father, the toddler looked chic in a baby blue dress. She completed the patriotic look with a pair of white knee-high socks and red flats. Harry and his daughter looked <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>like twins</a> as her red tresses matched the 38-year-old’s (see photo of Harry as a baby below). His daughter added a sweet touch with black bows pinned to her hair. Meghan was also dressed for the occasion and appeared to be wearing a similar blue ensemble to match Lilibet.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>family of four</a> enjoyed the parade in Montecito, where they notably <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>moved in 2020</a>. While they watched the parade, Meghan switched with her hubby in carrying their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two-year-old</a>, as she was pictured kneeling down with Lilibet during the parade. The former Senior Royals were accompanied by an elderly couple and a few other young children, presumably friends of their kiddos. Harry also made sure to fully immerse himself with the community and was spotted shoulder-to-shoulder with other parade goers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/prince-harry-lilibet-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Meghan and Harry’s outing with their children comes two days after the lovebirds were spotted <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>packing on the PDA</a> in Santa Barbara on Jul. 2.

The mother-of-two looked stylish in a pair of brown shorts and a white button-up blouse. Meghan completed the look with a beach hat, a leather belt, black sunglasses, and sandals. Harry, for his part, opted for a green polo shirt and jeans.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Aside from being couple goals this weekend, Meghan and Harry have recently cut ties with Spotify, as reported by the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New York Post&nbsp;</a>on Jun. 15.
