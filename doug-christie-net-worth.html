A two times WCC Player of the Year, Doug Christie had an opportunity to play for some of the best basketball teams in NBA, including the Los Angeles “Lakers”, Toronto “Raptors”, Sacramento “Kings”, Orlando “Magic” and Los Angeles “Clippers”. Throughout his career, Doug Christie made the NBA All-Defensive First Team, was a part of the NBA All-Defensive Second Team three times, and was chosen as the Toronto “Raptors” all-time leader in steals.</p><h3>Doug Christie Net Worth $50 Million</h3><p>A famous former basketball player, how rich is Doug Christie? In 2006, Christie’s salary with the Dallas “Mavericks” amounted to $1.5 million, while that same year he received $8.2 million for playing for the Orlando “Magic”. A year later, in 2007, Christie’s salary with the Los Angeles “Clippers”, with whom he signed a 10-day contract, amounted to $158 071. In regards to his wealth, Doug Christie’s net worth is estimated to be $50 million.</p><p>Doug Christie was born in 1970, in Seattle, Washington, where he was raised by his mother. Christie’s interest in basketball stems from his childhood, but it was in Mark Morris High School, under the training of Dave Denny, that Christie started looking at basketball as a future career opportunity. Both in Mark Morris High School and Rainier Beach High School, Christie played on the basketball teams, and even led his latter team to the Washington state championship. Christie then enrolled in Pepperdine University, where he studied sociology.</p><p>Soon enough, he became known in the whole country. In 1992, Doug Christie entered the NBA Draft and was chosen as the 17th pick for the Seattle “SuperSonics”. Due to issues with his contract, Christie never joined his teammates on the court but was traded to the Los Angeles “Lakers” instead. However, Christie did not get much playing time with the “Lakers” either and spent the majority of games on the bench. He was later traded to the New York “Knicks”, before he finally joined the Toronto “Raptors” where he established himself as a consistent player and was even given a position in the starting five of the team.</p><p>Christie played for “Raptors” for four seasons, until he was once again traded, this time to the Sacramento “Kings” in 2000. It was with this team that Christie reached his career high and became one of the team’s best shooting guards, 3pt-shooters, as well as defenders. Before his career-ending injury, Christie managed to play for two more teams, namely the “Magic” and the “Mavericks”. In 2005, Doug Christie suffered an ankle injury, which signified the end of his basketball career, and even though he signed a 10-day contract with the “Clippers” in 2007, he never returned to play basketball professionally.</p><p>When he retired from basketball, Doug Christie turned to television and even appeared in several television series, including his own reality show “The Christies Committed”, “Basketball Wives: LA”, as well as “<a href=#>Rickey Smiley</a> Show”.</p><p>A famous former basketball player, Doug Christie currently has an estimated net worth of $50 million.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=17.163636363636><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Doug Christie</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$50 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 9, 1970</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Died</td><td>March 11, 2013, Victoria, Canada, March 11, 2013, Victoria, Canada</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Seattle, Washington, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.98&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>201 lbs (91 kg)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Basketball player</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Education</td><td>Pepperdine University, Mark Morris High School, Rainier Beach High School, Pepperdine University, Mark Morris High School, Rainier Beach High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Jackie Christie (m. 1996)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Chantel Christie, Douglas Christie Jr.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Parents</td><td>John Malone, Norma Christie, Norma Christie, John Malone</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Кристи, Дуг</td></tr><tr readability=0.3265306122449><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/doug.christie.73</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.28070175438596><td>LinkedIn</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://au.linkedin.com/in/doug-christie-a5ab2a50</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm1859939</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Awards</td><td>NBA All-Defensive Team, NBA All-Defensive Team</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Sister Code, Sister Code</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=1.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Always raises his left fist, extending his pinkie and index fingers to signal his wife during games</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Sister Code</td><td>2015</td><td></td><td>Athlete</td></tr><tr><td>Comedy Bang!
