In the pic, taken with her friend Odessa Rae, the Killing Me Softly star looked incredible in a white bikini and a wide-brimmed beach hat.</p><p>“You’re 25, right?” wrote <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of her followers</a>. Another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commented</a>, “Still rockin’ the perfect bikini body.”</p><p>The star is best known for her role as Rollergirl in the 1997 drama film Boogie Nights. Graham was in her 20’s when she played a young porn star in the movie and she was even nominated for a SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.</p><p>More than 20 years later, the Wisconsin native’s body still looks as good as it did in the iconic ’90s movie — and that’s not an exaggeration! Us Weekly’s Stylish did some digging to find photos of the former Garnier spokeswoman taken on set of Boogie Nights.</p><p>In the pics, Graham wears a polka dot one-piece swim dress styled with yellow heart-shaped sunglasses. Her hair was styled down and parted in the center with two small braids on both sides of her head.</p><p>These days, the star’s style looks a lot different than Rollergirls’ in 1997. She’s traded the heart-shaped sunnies for oversized chic shades and is a big fan of bikinis, as opposed to that unforgettable swim dress.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see some of the movie star’s hottest bikini moments from over the years!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvHnpitoJWneqi%2BwKGYpqtdnby1wMSsq2aamaC2r7WMpqamnZ6pwG671Z6pZqyYmnq6scCrqmaomZjAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
