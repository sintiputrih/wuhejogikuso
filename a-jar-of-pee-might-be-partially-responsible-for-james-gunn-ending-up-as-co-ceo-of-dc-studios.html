It can’t be a coincidence that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Snyder admitted Warner Bros. hated the film</a>, while writer Chris Terrio <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fired several shots of his own at the studio</a>. The Ultimate Edition is vastly superior, no doubt, but the initial cut is still a 152-minute slog that literally weaponizes a jar of pee as a major plot point.</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>If you think about it, the DCU was on a downhill slope before Snyder even departed Justice League, with the infamous container of urine <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">regularly brought up alongside the dreaded Martha exchange as barometers of how the franchise was doomed to fail in its pursuit </a>of catching up to Marvel. The original architect dropped out, Whedon stepped in, the entire SnyderVerse fell apart, and now we’ve ended up with James Gunn and Peter Safran steering the ship.</p><p data-characters=654 data-current-count=654 data-injectable=false>In an even more insane twist of fate you couldn’t make up, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">if Kevin Feige hadn’t fired Gunn from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 to send him scurrying across town to DC in the first place</a>, then we wouldn’t be in this situation either. Remarkably, then, you could realistically state that if it wasn’t for a $300 million disappointment boasting a jar of pee in a major supporting role or unsavory tweets from a decade prior made by someone who’d never worked with DC before being brought to light, then we wouldn’t be in the position we are now with Chapter 1 – Gods & Monsters on the cards. Only in Hollywood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGaikad6sLKMqZyeZZ2etKnAjJucZqiRp8GqrculsGaqlai9sLrSopmlnV2bvLN5yZqknqtdnMKvuoyepZ2hnpx6tryMmqpmm59isKa7jKidZpyTYsC1wcOipqxn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
