Stuff like that.”</p><p>Though he wasn’t always shown in a positive light, the Just Add X founder said all the drama he brought to the show was warranted&nbsp;— and will pay off for Cruz in the end.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Brittany-Cartwright-Cruz-Will-Not-Be-A-Fan-of-Dad-Jax-Taylor-When-He-Watches-Pump-Rules-Promo.jpg><p>“A lot of the stuff I did kept those shows going. … I had to keep it interesting,” Jax said. “Buddy, your college was paid for because of that.”</p><p>Brittany and Jax are among several former SUR staffers who&nbsp;recently welcomed babies. The Michigan native’s ex <a href=#><strong>Stassi Schroeder</strong></a>&nbsp;gave birth to her <a href=#>daughter, Hartford</a>, in January. <a href=#><strong>Lala Kent</strong> </a>was next in line, <a href=#>welcoming daughter Ocean</a> in March. About two weeks after Cruz was born, <a href=#><strong>Scheana Shay</strong> </a><a href=#>welcomed her daughter, Summer</a>, on April 26.</p><p>“I think it would be hilarious if one of them ended up dating down the road. If he’s <a href=#>his father’s son</a>, he might date all three of them,” Jax said. “They’re all [going to] grow up as best friends.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmroaSprq%2FFjJyYq6ynp7aotNNmmKecXZ%2BuuXnTmrClp6JiwaK4ymaaq62qYsSiwMKhoKefXaXCrryMq6ylnaNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
