She played Pete Campbell, Kartheiser's character's mistress, for three seasons.</p><p class=dh>However, Kartheiser said they chose to remain professional while filming the hit show. Despite prioritizing their work over their relationship, Matthew Weiner, creator of "Mad Men," said he knew Bledel and Kartheiser were going to get married the first time they met.

Kartheiser felt it was essential to keep certain parts of his life private; he said if he shared the most important things with the world, it cheapened and weakened it.</p><p class=dh>Kartheiser's "Mad Men" co-star, Jon Hamm, said Kartheiser liked Bledel from the start and that he was a supporter of their relationship. In October 2012, Kartheiser and Bledel stepped out in public together and attended the Macallan Masters of Photography Series launch in New York City.</p><p class=dh>In 2013 they were each other's dates to the 19th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards at The Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.

At the season six premiere of "Mad Men," he revealed that he would occasionally call Bledel his girlfriend and then remember they were engaged.</p><p class=dh>Bledel said they intended to plan their wedding together; at the time, they had not started the wedding planning process yet, but she was not shy to flaunt the round-cut diamond ring that she said Kartheiser picked out.</p><p class=dh>In October 2013, they attended Bledel's "Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" co-star Amber Tamblyn and David Cross's wedding.
