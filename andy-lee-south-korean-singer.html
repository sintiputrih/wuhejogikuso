Solbi and Andy made their official exit from We Got Married on October 5, 2008. He has taken an active career in stage such as playing as playing a 19-year-old in the musical Polaroid in August 2008, as well as live concerts throughout September and October. He has also produced a two-member boy band called Jumper under his company ND Entertainment.

As Shinhwa was on hiatus, Lee return to acting in September 2007 to act as the lead role in a musical "Music In My Heart (Season 3)", a type of project that none of the Shinhwa members have tried to pursue yet. After finishing performances for the musical, Lee released his very first digital single, titled "Irrelevant [or Extraordinary] Imagination" on November 30, 2007, a cover from the group Rollercoaster's song. Due to the help of Park Jin Young (also known as JYP; CEO of JYP Entertainment) and Yubin of Wonder Girls, Lee was able to have a successful single. Yubin rapped while JYP wrote the lyrics for the rap part in the song. With the help, Lee was able to attract a lot of attention for the single.
