The author is said to publish multiple novels each year, and even allegedly works 20 hours at a time to complete her books. The writer’s books often include drama and romance, as well as people with lavish lifestyles (via Biography). Steel is also known for creating strong female characters, much like her fellow author Fannie Flagg.</p><p dir=ltr>Because she has penned so many books throughout her career, it may be hard for readers new to her work to figure out where to start. Most of Steel’s books are standalone novels, which means you can pick them up and read them without worrying about missing a novel in a series. A good way to dive into the author’s extensive novels is to take stock of her most popular books and find one that sounds intriguing to you.</p><p>Goodreads notes that other Steel fans have rated her books over the years and that novels such as “Safe Harbour,” “Sisters,” “The Gift,” “Zoya,” “Accident,” “Fine Things,” and “The Promise” are among her most popular works. If you’re looking for a recommendation about which Steel book to pick up first, many readers may encourage you to check out one of her earlier works titled “Kaleidoscope.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tooZZixrDB1Z5kp52mmr9uvsSam2aZnq7BqbXNoGSbsV2Zrq%2B1xKWjnmWjqbKmuIyhnKudo2LBqbGMm6aoo12uvLZ50qGmrqSUYsC1rdGtZLChpJ18</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
