But from what we’ve seen, the duo had the best chance out the gate! The couple was a good fit based on key factors like ambitions and past upbringing.</span></p><p><span>As per Nate, he was “looking forward” to finding a lifelong travel buddy to whom he was “mentally, spiritually, and physically attracted to.” And although he did admit that finding a perfect partner is “intentional high-risk, high reward,” his mindset led him to trust the experts to do the job for him.</span></p><p><span>The experts, that season, were Pastor Cal, Dr. Pepper, DeVon Franklin, and Dr. Pia Holec.</span></p><p><span>Our star further added that he signed up for MAFS because he wanted a “best friend, partner, and somebody to explore the whole world with.” But when waiting at the altar, realizing he was in an experimental show, he thought to himself, “What the hell did I sign up for?”</span></p><p><span>Luckily, the beautiful Stacia was able to calm him down. Just one look at Stacia, Nate was instantly charmed. The two then exchanged vows and proceeded to sign a prenup, Stacia even asked Nate to sign a postnup after asking about his credit score. This might be a turn-off to some. But Nate was already diving head first into the experiment.</span></p><p><span>Talking about Stacia, she might have joined MAFS for a different reason, but her ultimate goal overlapped with that of Nate. While Nate was hoping to find a lifelong travel buddy Stacia was looking for a man that meets her “high standards.”</span></p><p><span>“I refuse to settle. I’d rather be single than settle just to say I’m in a relationship,” she explained. Also, the charmer added the “most important thing” she was looking for in a relationship was “trust” —&nbsp; “I want to know wholeheartedly that I can trust my partner with anything. He is a safe place for me to land, to be vulnerable, and that I can trust his intentions,” she added.</span></p><p><span>Joining Nate and Stacia for season 15 of MAFS were their co-stars — Lindy and Miguel, Krysten and Mitch, Alexis and Justin, and Morgan and Binh.</span></p><h3><b>Nate Barnes Height</b></h3><p><span>Nate Barnes stands tall at a height of 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm).</span></p><p><span>Mentioning his distinct features, Nate has long face, brown eyes, and a wide beautiful smile.</span></p><p><span>Also, he had a different hairstyle before joining MAFS.
