Malik had gone out with some buddies the night of his senseless murder to a teen dance club in a Salt Lake City neighborhood. He stuck around though when his companions left to get supper since the DJ had finally played his tune.</p><p class=ne>According to the L. A Times, “ a witness said Malik was backing away when Leota hit him so hard that Malik was lifted six inches off the ground. Malik’s head struck something as he fell.
