The news of his death quickly circulated over Twitter.</p><p>His exact cause of death is not disclosed yet, although according to some sources, he was suffering from Covid-19 problems, which caused him to be hospitalized for many days.</p><p>Dr. Bryan Ardis, a former chiropractor who promotes disproved anti-vaxx and anti-hospital-treatment beliefs, was a guest on Paul’s podcast.</p><p>Paul also continued to protest against vaccinations despite the death of one of his pastor buddies from COVID.</p><p>Some individuals were ardent supporters of Paul, while others were enraged at him because of his critical statements about the vaccine.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=paul-oebel-wikipedia-details-to-know></span>Paul Oebel Wikipedia Details To Know<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paul saw a need to bring attention to “Unknown, or Hidden” persons who had God’s abilities and talents, so he founded the Faith Unveiled Network.</p><p>According to&nbsp;faithunveilednetwork.com, God has given amazing gifts to preachers, teachers, musicians, clothing designers, artists, cooks, and many more.</p><p>The company’s mission is to extend these skills to mobile devices, home and office PCs, and on-the-go computers.</p><p>Currently, the Faith Unveiled Network offers video and audio services to share these skills.</p><p>According to some online users, Paul was an anti-vaxxer who circulated unfavorable remarks about the Covid-19 vaccination.</p><p>In one of Paul’s posts, he said “I have a legitimate question for those that are vaccinated. Have you considered why Congress, Biden’s Administration, Post Office that demands a facial masks to this day, creators of the vaccine, employees of the vaccine maker companies, the CEO’s of vaccination companies, CDC employees, illegal immigrants, are all exempt and/or refuse to get the vaccination themselves?</p><p>As a matter of fact, the CEO of these vaccines companies are not allowing their children to be vaccinated. And are you aware the FDA voted 16-3 to NOT approve the Pfizer booster shot? Looking for your explanation and reasoning. And have you ask yourself, why they’re refusing it, especially the CEO’s?”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=was-paul-married-wife-name-explored></span>Was Paul Married? Wife Name Explored<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At the time of his death, Paul was married and had a wife. Unfortunately, no information about his wife has been released.</p><p>Although in one of his posts, he mentioned his wife, stating “My wife and I pray daily for those that have been vaccinated. We don’t want anyone to suffer loss, but we’ve already loss friends directly due to the vaccine.</p><p>Currently, more people are dying due of the EXPERIMENTAL vaccine, than the actual virus. It is predicted globally, that 1.2 BILLION people will die due to this experiment, within the next 5 years. We all have relatives and friends that have been vaccinated, and we don’t want to lose them. We’re praying that God not allow this catastrophe to not happen, simply because people were lied to.”`</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutMCpp56mlZl6tbuMqZiupF2ksqOxy2admqGknXq2utWeoKWdlGLBt3nBq6aanJOWwLWx0WabnpmknXqnvs6mZJynpp6xcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
