The monster forces its victims to see visions — strange, memory-slash-mental images.</p><p>In Ambar's case, she sees herself sitting by her mother's deathbed. The mental image serves as a recurring motif throughout the movie. Either way, she doesn't let it fool her — which might be one of the reasons why she doesn't fall victim to the monster.</p><p>Ambar turns out to be the only character of the movie who survives. She kills Red and Becker, the evil brothers responsible for feeding new victims to the hideous creature in the basement.</p><p>In a crucial scene of the movie, she discovers that the monster also has healing capacities — and that it can help cure injuries like a broken foot.
