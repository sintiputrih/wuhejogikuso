But it seems that dating and relationship experience has helped Izzy narrow down what, exactly, he’s looking for in a partner. After past relationships were “not on the same page emotionally,” he hopes to find “open-minded, good communicator” who loves him “unconditionally,” he shared in his bio. He also mentions his preference for a blonde woman who likes going to the gym and playing beach volleyball.</p><p>So, will he find her? To find out, fans will have to watch the latest chapter week to week (all culminating in the Oct. 13 finale). In the meantime, here’s everything to know about Izzy from Love Is Blind Season 5.</p><h2>Izzy’s Job</h2><p>According to Izzy’s Love Is Blind bio, the 31-year-old works in sales.</p><h2>Izzy’s Instagram</h2><p>Izzy’s Instagram is filled with snaps from <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>outings with friends,</a> <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>golf,</a> and <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>travel adventures</a> — though it’s not clear if a significant other is accompanying him on his recent post-pods trips. As is typical with Love Is Blind contestants, you won’t find any clues or spoilers about Izzy’s current relationship status just yet.</p><h2>Izzy’s Past Relationship & Family</h2><p>As Izzy revealed in the first Love Is Blind teaser, he was previously engaged before looking for love in the pods. This prompted pod partner Johnie Maraist to share that she, too, had been in a serious relationship before — a marriage, in fact. “If me and you can potentially get married, you’re not gonna hold anything back from me, and I’m not gonna hold anything back from you,” Izzy said, assuaging any doubts.</p><p>Izzy’s past relationship doesn’t seem to be represented on his social media accounts — but he has made it clear he’s a <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>dog dad.</a></p><p>Because of Izzy’s familiar last name, you might think Izzy is related to another Love Is Blind contestant: <a href=# class=T3D>Season 2’s Mallory Zapata</a>. However, there’s no indication that the two are related, and Mallory doesn’t seem to follow Izzy on Instagram. (Izzy does follow Mallory... but he also follows a lot of other Love Is Blind alums, too.) It’s most likely just another coincidence, à la <a href=# class=T3D>Matt and Cole Barnett</a> from Season 1 and Season 3, respectively.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqKyqq56u63PmquaZZykw6Z5yKxkm6SZo7Futs6bZKKmo6muqL7ApmSboZ8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
