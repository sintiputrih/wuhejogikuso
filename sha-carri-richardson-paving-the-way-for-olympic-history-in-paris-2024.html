Born in Dallas, Texas (March 25th, 2000) Richardson's story exemplifies determination and commitment to greatness under the most austere circumstances.</p><h2 data-id=86531ba9-8b5d-4a72-acec-5a25d7e4271d data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-mce-fragment=1><br data-mce-fragment=1>Rising from Adversity</h2><p data-id=86531ba9-8b5d-4a72-acec-5a25d7e4271d data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-mce-fragment=1>At a young age, Richardson has met the path to victory with her natural talents and resolve. Growing up with her grandmother and aunt, the nine-and-a-half-year-old&nbsp;Richardson had discovered running. After her mother told of track and field successes, Richardson decided to try a course that would eventually place her among the fastest women in the world.</p><p data-id=86531ba9-8b5d-4a72-acec-5a25d7e4271d data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-mce-fragment=1>Richardson was a fast-rising star in high school, where she won three Texas state titles and also held the top ranking among college sprinters for her class (2018). Those consistent performances on the national stage, with wins at the AAU Junior Olympics in the 100-meter dash being one of them laid a strong foundation for what would come.</p><h2 data-id=86531ba9-8b5d-4a72-acec-5a25d7e4271d data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-mce-fragment=1><br data-mce-fragment=1>Collegiate, Pro Career</h2><p data-id=86531ba9-8b5d-4a72-acec-5a25d7e4271d data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-mce-fragment=1>Just after arriving at Louisiana State University (LSU), Richardson made her talent felt on the track. In 2019, she finished her freshman season undefeated in the 100 meters with a time of 10.75 seconds to set the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) record and earned The Bowerman award as collegiate women's track & field athlete of the year.&nbsp;</p><p data-id=86531ba9-8b5d-4a72-acec-5a25d7e4271d data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-mce-fragment=1><br data-mce-fragment=1>Entering a pro-competition, Richardson inked a rich Nike deal that marked her as someone to watch in the sprint world.</p><h2 data-id=86531ba9-8b5d-4a72-acec-5a25d7e4271d data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-mce-fragment=1><br data-mce-fragment=1>Triumph and Setbacks</h2><p data-id=86531ba9-8b5d-4a72-acec-5a25d7e4271d data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-mce-fragment=1>Queens native Richardson - who hails from Dallas, Texas, but has long called New York home and ran for Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge before turning pro ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics that later booted her after a positive marijuana test prompted debate over adverse action against an African American woman contender. But a year later Richardson returned to the biggest stage in Budapest of 2023 and won her signature event at 100m, as well as taking gold with her US team-mates in the sprint relay where she was crowned the world's fastest woman.<br data-mce-fragment=1>Her breakneck speed and the steel in her resolve endeared her to fans while impressing all who watched, paving a prospect's path that will no doubt see&nbsp;Richardson representing Team USA at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics.</p><h2 data-id=86531ba9-8b5d-4a72-acec-5a25d7e4271d data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-mce-fragment=1><br data-mce-fragment=1>Path to Paris</h2><p data-id=86531ba9-8b5d-4a72-acec-5a25d7e4271d data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-mce-fragment=1>Richardson, on her electric glide and sing-through-the-fire determination, is about to make a scene -- this year in Paris. Focusing on the 100m and 200 m fast,&nbsp;Richardson will separate herself with her talent as well as personality (with a smile that can light up anyone).<br data-mce-fragment=1>Richardson's -journey is a true story of resilience and overcoming struggles to become great. Her story serves as an inspiration for every young athlete and anyone out there just trying to surmount their obstacles.</p><h2 data-id=86531ba9-8b5d-4a72-acec-5a25d7e4271d data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-mce-fragment=1><br data-mce-fragment=1>Paris</h2><p data-id=86531ba9-8b5d-4a72-acec-5a25d7e4271d data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-mce-fragment=1><br data-mce-fragment=1>The eyes of the world will be serving the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics, as everyone looks forward to Sha'Carri Richardson and the bright, lightning-fast star who can make you reconsider what it typically means to&nbsp;be legendary.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0mimpbGdpbakv46sn5plk5a%2Fs7WMq6CcoJGnsbS7zWanmq6Zo7RuwMeeZLCZqWKzsL6MqKOypaCesG60yKyrqKqpYravec%2BaqaKrXWd9c4A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
