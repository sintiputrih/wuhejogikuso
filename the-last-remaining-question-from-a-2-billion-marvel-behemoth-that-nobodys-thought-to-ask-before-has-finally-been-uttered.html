The Aether has always been sort of a problem. According to the filmmakers, it was never supposed to be an Infinity Stone during the making of Thor: The Dark World. It was just your standard space macguffin. If they’d meant for it to be a stone, they wouldn’t have made it look like someone was vaping the Carnage symbiote. They would’ve made it look like a stone.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/169q2cl/i_wouldve_likes_to_see_thanos_solidify_the_aether/</figure><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=785 data-injectable=true>A couple of reshoots and ADRs later, the smokey red goo at the center of the Thor movie that everyone skips during MCU marathons had become the Reality Stone. We didn’t get an on-screen explanation for how the plot-driving cosmic oobleck wound up in a form that could be contained in the knuckle duster of an angry space grape, just shots of the aftermath: Thanos with a glove full of Reality powers, turning energy blasters into bubble wands and Benecio del Toro into a day player.</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>From what we’d seen of the Aether up to this point, it needed a container to keep it held together – either a vessel, like the one that the Warriors Three used to deliver it to the Collector, or a fleshy body-shaped one, like the one that used to run things on Naboo.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>And so we get the last possible question available to ask about Infinity War: When Thanos got the Reality Stone, did it get sucked up inside him like it did with everyone else who touched it? And if it did, did he have to extract it like they wound up doing with Rocket and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bro Thor in Endgame</a>?</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=205 data-injectable=false>Come to think of it, how did the Avengers get the Reality Stone to solidify in Endgame? We see it after Rocket pulls it out of past-Jane’s body, but again, no explanation for how they firmed it up.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=126 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>Probably corn starch, right? It feels like the sort of thing that you could add some body to with a little bit of corn starch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedlr%2B3sctoq6GdXaGutMCMq5ymmZmjtq%2BzjKqsnquknryvecWrpqZlkWJ%2Fbq7IpaOip55iuqK%2B1Z6jZpqVnbKuu9OhZK2gkal6r7vBqJuyq12ptbDBxqGrZqyfYq60t4ybnJ%2Bnopp6qa3SZp2ippGhubp5wZ6cp2WlqcGmvsSdZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
