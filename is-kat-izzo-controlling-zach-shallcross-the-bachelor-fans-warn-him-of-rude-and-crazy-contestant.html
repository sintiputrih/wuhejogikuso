Zach was unable to attend any group dates or his planned one-on-one date with Charity because he tested positive for <a href=# rel>Covid</a>&nbsp;last week. So, in Episode 6, his first date was with Charity, and he went to the girls' villa to pick his date. But drama ensued the moment he stepped into the frame with the ladies.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>No rose after group date!

Zach enters the room after Gabi Elnicki has read the date card. "Charity, let‚Äôs make up for lost time," Gabi reads aloud to the ladies.</p><p>"I‚Äôm still obviously on his mind," Charity says after receiving the one-on-one date, adding, "It really feels good to know he wants this one-on-one just as much as I do."</p><p>Zach then approaches the contestants' room, intending to take Charity on a date, however, Kat stops him. "Zach, before you go, can you come with me?" Kat asks Zach. Zach agrees and they walk into the corridor alone. "I just missed you and I wanted to say hi to you before you left," she says before kissing him.</p><p>"Zach came here specifically for Charity and Kat steals him like we‚Äôre at a f***ing cocktail party," Brooklyn says to the cameras. Charity also mentions how the timeliness of Kat's remark felt out of place.</p><p>"What could you possibly tell him that‚Äôs gonna change your path in this?"

Me: BECAUSE IT WAS CHARITYS MOMENT." Another viewer pointed out, "Not Kat having a completely different personality when she talks to Zach vs the other girls."</p><p>Slamming her for her actions, a fan wrote, "Being called out on desperate, trash behavior is not being ‚Äúattacked‚Äù.
