With all these loveable and endearing qualities, which of these old men is considered the best of the best? The following men listed who are also “long in the tooth” in cartoons are ranked in order, from lowest to highest.</p><h2 id=h-stan-lee-in-teen-titans-go-to-the-movies data-injectable=false>Stan Lee in Teen Titans Go! To the Movies</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>While it’s probably unexpected here, the man himself, the legendary comic book icon, the late <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stan Lee</a></strong> gets a spot on this list thanks to him doing something that’s been long admired during his lifetime. He made one of his countless cameos, but this was one of his rare appearances that took place outside his usual <a href=#>Marvel Comics</a> universe and into the rival <a href=#>DC Comics</a> universe within the 2018 superhero movie, <a href=#>Teen Titans Go! To the Movies</a>.</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>It’s definitely one of his more unique appearances, especially considering he makes a quick exit from the film once he realizes he’s indeed not inside a Marvel Comics production. However, the gimmick becomes endearing when he eventually reappears, indifferent to whichever universe he’s in as long as he gets to make a cameo, also capping things off with his trademark, “Excelsior!”, upon parting ways for good.</p><h2 id=h-louis-kalhern-pickles-also-known-as-grandpa-lou-from-rugrats data-injectable=false>Louis Kalhern Pickles, also known as “Grandpa Lou,” from Rugrats</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=559 data-current-count=859 data-injectable=true>In the popular 1990s Nickelodeon cartoon, <a href=#>Rugrats</a>, the loveable Grandpa Lou, is the eldest member of the Pickles family. He’s grandfather to Tommy, Dil, and Angelica and is just as important as the little babies who were the focal point of the show. Grandpa Lou, who’s often full of stories is frequently entrusted by the children’s parents to babysit the little ones but always seems to drift into a nap – possibly because of his old age. This leaves the door open for Tommy and his playmates to engage in their amazing quests, uninterrupted.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>Of course, Grandpa would conveniently wake up once the babies’ adventures came to a close. Many fans of the series could argue that perhaps if not for his napping, many of the imaginary adventures featured in the cartoon’s episodes might not have ever taken place. But when Grandpa isn’t napping, he’s sure to bestow any and every bit of wisdom on anyone in earshot.</p><h2 id=h-abraham-jebediah-abe-simpson-ii-also-known-as-grampa-simpson-from-the-simpsons data-injectable=false>Abraham Jebediah “Abe” Simpson II, also known as Grampa Simpson, from The Simpsons</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>No one would be expected to seem wiser in Springfield, or at least as part of the cast of more popular characters than Grampa Abe should be in <a href=#>The Simpsons</a>. However, he appears to be far from it, often seen napping more than baby Maggie in numerous episodes. Or, just missing the point as he rambles on during important conversations, likely due to some possible dementia?</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>Regardless, Grampa is just as much a pillar of the Simpsons universe, despite not being seen as often as the more regular characters. Whether or not he himself can remember correctly, he was an important part of history, occasionally revealing his exploits as a past war hero.</p><h2 id=h-robert-jebediah-freeman-also-known-as-granddad-from-the-boondocks data-injectable=false>Robert Jebediah Freeman, also known as “Granddad,” from The Boondocks</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>Like many of the men on this list, this gentleman is a proud grandfather. Robert Jebediah Freeman, most commonly referred to as “Granddad” is one of the three lead protagonists, alongside his two grandsons Huey and Riley. Their hilarious anime-styled adventures focus on African-American race relations in the suburbs of the fictional town of Woodcrest.</p><p data-characters=552 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>Also known as “Pops,” or even the self-proclaimed, “Mr. B*tches”, the war veteran and happily retired Robert usually features rather funnily in episodes where he’s trying to find love in the arms of at least one woman at a time. There are even moments when he’ll try explaining his time as a civil rights activist – which is often exaggerated, or try foolishly to engage in some sort of get-rich-quick scheme. Above all, Granddad just wants some occasional peace from his unruly and sometimes dangerously rebellious grandsons.</p><h2 id=h-iroh-also-known-as-general-iroh-or-uncle-from-avatar-the-last-airbender data-injectable=false>Iroh, also known as General Iroh or “Uncle,” from Avatar: The Last Airbender</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>One of the wisest in the universe of <a href=#>Avatar: The Last Airbender</a> is Iroh, the one who seems to know all there is about wielding power to manipulate nature. He is a firebender and former General of the Fire Nation. Iroh spends much of his time in exile as a mentor to Zuko, who is also on the outs from the Fire Nation, on their quest for enlightenment.</p><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>Once a man of rage and aggression during his military days associated with the Fire Nation, audiences see Iroh as a man of infinite wisdom who has a great affinity for a good cup of tea. What also makes him stand out more than others is his noticeably easy-going mindset, having been declared a traitor to his own people. Such an attitude often makes him appear unlikely that so much fire – pun intended, can come from such an open-minded and peace-loving individual like Iroh.</p><h2 id=h-master-roshi-also-known-in-the-u-s-as-turtle-hermit-or-jackie-chun-from-the-original-dragon-ball-series data-injectable=false>Master Roshi, also known in the U.S. as Turtle Hermit or Jackie Chun, from the original Dragon Ball series</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=697 data-current-count=997 data-injectable=true>In most likely the most popular anime series of all time, Master Roshi, from the Original <a href=#>Dragon Ball</a> series definitely ranks high on this list. Ever since first being featured in Chapter Three of 1984’s Dragon Ball manga, Roshi has also gone by the name of “Turtle Hermit”, or “Jackie Chun” during the character’s long run in the series’ universe. Apart from his few aliases, Roshi is also known for training Dragon Ball fighters&nbsp;Goku, Krillin, and Yamcha. While he was often portrayed in a sexually suggestive, foolish, and often questionable manner through much of his time on-screen, he was originally thought of as one of the strongest fighters in the Dragon Ball universe.</p><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>At one point, the popularity of his character had dimmed somewhat but regained his favorability during the two Dragon Ball series: Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’, and Dragon Ball Super of the 2010s. It was at this time when Master Roshi joined Goku in an ongoing battle against Frieza, with planet Earth hanging in the balance. Throughout all of his time in the Dragon Ball universe, he has become one of the most widely-known characters, no matter what name he goes by.</p><h2 id=h-rick-sanchez-from-rick-and-morty data-injectable=false>Rick Sanchez, from Rick and Morty</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=757 data-injectable=true>Likely one of the most hated lifeforms in every universe and dimension, <a href=#>Rick Sanchez</a> is a character like no other, even if he wasn’t on this list. But he’s so damn entertaining! Perhaps his toxic behavior is what keeps him from the top spot here. Likely because he’s doing things like driving an emotional wedge between his daughter and her husband, to sitting back and watching his grandchildren Summer and Morty often competing for his approval.</p><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true>Another mark against him is that Rick is often under the influence of booze, drugs, or some other-worldly substance, which isn’t always a good look. But the man is also far beyond a certified genius and somehow has an answer for everything or at least enough time to use his brain to solve whatever problem is at hand. It makes every episode a grossly hilarious experience you can’t turn away from, even if you’ve watched each one countless times.</p><h2 id=h-uncle-scrooge-from-disney-s-ducktales data-injectable=false>Uncle Scrooge, from Disney’s DuckTales</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=757 data-injectable=true>For many folks out there, we fondly remember Uncle Scrooge McDuck, from Disney’s <a href=#>DuckTales</a>. The tales themselves wouldn’t have ever taken place if not for his penchant (and affordability) for adventure-seeking. Scrooge was a billionaire who never minded to share his wealth and time with his great-nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie throughout all four original seasons (1987-1900) and three more seasons of the recently rebooted series (2017-2021).</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>Together, the ducks had all sorts of expensive exploits from treasure hunting to fending off villains from attempting to steal Uncle Scrooge’s riches. With a relative like that, who doesn’t like a rich uncle?</p><h2 id=h-professor-charles-xavier-also-known-as-professor-x-from-the-1990s-x-men-animated-series data-injectable=false>Professor Charles Xavier, also known as Professor X from the 1990s X-Men animated series</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>Professor Charles Xavier, the powerful, intelligent, and even wiser leader of the <a href=#>X-Men</a> is by far, one of the greatest “old men” to be attached to this list. With so many versions of the character to be found throughout the decades of Marvel Comics history, it’s the Professor from the hit 1990s animated show on the Fox Kids Network that’s deserving of a spot on this list.</p><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=833 data-injectable=true>Through all of their adventures, Professor X, a mutant himself, masterfully leads his X-Men in the ongoing fight to achieve peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants, all while saving the universe. Often considered a genius in his own right and one of the most powerful characters in the Marvel universe, Charles is consistently known as a leader, skillful tactician, voice of reason, and father figure during the course of this animated series.</p><h2 id=h-carl-fredricksen-from-up data-injectable=false>Carl Fredricksen, from Up</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=799 data-injectable=true>From the beloved 2009 Pixar movie Up is the endearing <a href=#>Carl Fredricksen</a>. When audiences first lay eyes on him, he’s undeniably grumpy, as many old men stereotypically are considered. The retired helium balloon salesman spent a lot of time coping with the loss of his beloved wife, playing into his isolation during the early stages of the film. Carl is quickly faced with a dilemma that he seemingly cannot escape, literally, until he gets the idea to fly away (house and all) to South America.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>Along with a young boy scout named Russell, Carl is able to withstand his adversaries and navigate his house to Paradise Falls, a dream destination he and his late wife were meant to experience. When the audience gets past the tugging of the heartstrings during the first act of this film, every viewer can’t help but want Carl to achieve a happy end to his life-long journey.</p><h2 id=h-alfred-pennyworth-from-batman-the-animated-series data-injectable=false>Alfred Pennyworth, from Batman: The Animated Series</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>Another significant elder in the world of superhero animation is Batman’s most trusted ally, the Wayne family butler, Alfred Pennyworth. This pick represents the version of the character featured in the extremely popular <a href=#>Batman: The Animated Series</a> that ran from 1993 to 1997. Just like nearly every iteration of the character throughout the history of Batman, Alfred serves as Bruce’s moral confidant and source of inspiration while providing comic relief with his sarcastic and sometimes cynical attitude, even in the worst moments.</p><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=true>What often sets this version of the butler apart from others is how he’s featured in some of the adventures. Alfred obviously gives insight and helps Master Bruce sleuth almost every mystery, but how often does Alfred actually take the controls of the Batwing, to swoop in and save Batman’s life, as he did in a classic season one episode? This one was a somewhat easy choice, considering how legendary the overall animated series was, compared to other cartoons featuring the Caped Crusader.</p><h2 id=h-the-genie-from-aladdin data-injectable=false>The Genie, from Aladdin</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://youtu.be/IYu6wqG3XPw</figure><p data-characters=476 data-current-count=776 data-injectable=true>This pick would likely be unexpected, if you’re going to argue that <a href=#>Aladdin</a>’s Genie isn’t old, despite his very youthful and energetic demeanor throughout the movie. Before you do, perhaps you should consider that he’s existed for at least 10,000 years, making this character the oldest on the list. He literally states this point upon being released from his lamp with his first spoken line proclaiming, “Ten thousand years can give you such a crick in the neck!”</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=false>From the time he emerges from captivity to the end credits, he’s for the most part a great joy for audiences to witness. What makes Genie among the very best “old guys” is based on his effortless sense of humor but more importantly, his zest for life, a life he’s never been able to experience while being bound to the lamp. He eventually gets his freedom to roam and experience everything that most of us humans take for granted, making him undoubtedly loveable for generations to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXWZ%2Fbq7ErKtmp5yZeq6tzWaamqqkpLyvecKhmKuZk6mys7%2BMq5ino5WZfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
