RRR would be a breakthrough for South Asian movies at the Globes, but given the Hollywood Foreign Press’ (poor) track record on such matters, we predict that Park Chan-wook’s moody neo-noir will take the honors.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=40 data-current-count=40 data-injectable=false><strong>Who we think will win:</strong> <strong>Decision to Leave</strong></p><h3 class=has-medium-font-size data-injectable=false><strong>Best Motion Picture, Animated</strong></h3><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false><strong>Nominees:</strong> Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio (Netflix), Inu-Oh (GKIDS), Marcel the Shell With Shoes On (A24), Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (DreamWorks Animation), Turning Red (Pixar).</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>Del Toro’s Pinocchio will almost certainly grab the globe with its blend of gravitas, stop-motion practicality, and Del Toro’s clout.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=32 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false><strong>Who we think will win:</strong> <strong>Pinocchio</strong></p><h2 data-injectable=false>Television</h2><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Best Television Series, Drama</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Severance-Apple-TV.jpg><p data-characters=120 data-current-count=120 data-injectable=false><strong>Nominees:</strong> Better Call Saul (AMC), The Crown (Netflix), House of the Dragon (HBO), Ozark (Netflix), Severance (Apple TV).</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true>This category will almost certainly come down to Severance — one of the buzziest shows of 2022 — and Better Call Saul, AMC’s first-time nominated prestige series, which just ended its six-season run. It’s possible that Ozark could clinch a surprise win, but when faced between a stalwart drama and a shiny new thing, it seems likely the HFPA will go with the latter.</p><p data-characters=32 data-current-count=32 data-injectable=false><strong>Who we think will win: Severance</strong></p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Best Television Series, Musical or Comedy</strong></h3><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=156 data-injectable=false><strong>Nominees:</strong> Abbott Elementary (ABC), The Bear (FX), Hacks (HBO Max), Only Murders in the Building (Hulu), Wednesday (Netflix).</p><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true>This is also a tough one. Will the Globes go with Hacks for a second year in a row, safe picks in either Abbott Elementary or Only Murders in the Building, or with newcomer series Wednesday or The Bear? While The Bear is certainly deserving, we have a feeling that Quinta Brunson’s beloved ABC sitcom about a group of scrappy and resourceful Philadelphia public school teachers will take home the prize.</p><p data-characters=40 data-current-count=40 data-injectable=false><strong>Who we think will win: Abbott Elementary</strong></p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series, Drama</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/better-call-saul-finale-2.jpg><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true><strong>Nominees:</strong> Jeff Bridges (The Old Man), Kevin Costner (Yellowstone), Diego Luna (Andor), Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul), Adam Scott (Severance).</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>It seems very likely that this category will come down to Bob Odenkirk in Better Call Saul or Adam Scott in Severance, though we could also see Diego Luna clinch a surprise win for Andor. But it would be nice to see Odenkirk win after his fifth nomination for Better Call Saul — particularly given his utterly heartbreaking performance in the final season.</p><p data-characters=35 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false><strong>Who we think will win: Bob Odenkirk</strong></p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series, Drama</strong></h3><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true><strong>Nominees:</strong> Emma D’Arcy (House of the Dragon), Laura Linney (Ozark), Imelda Staunton (The Crown), Hilary Swank (Alaska Daily), Zendaya (Euphoria).</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>HBO’s Game of Thrones prequel hasn’t managed to achieve the same level of pop culture zeitgeist as the original; however, we can’t count out Emma D’Arcy for her intense, brooding role of Rhaenyra Targaryen as she leads her family’s house into a civil war. Will it be enough to outshine Zendaya in Euphoria, or will the HFPA follow the lead Emmy voters? It’s tough to say.</p><p data-characters=36 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true><strong>Who we think will win: Emma D’Arcy</strong></p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Best Actress in a TV Series, Musical or Comedy</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/wednesday-jenna-ortega-dancing.jpg><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true><strong>Nominees:</strong> Quinta Brunson (Abbott Elementary), Kaley Cuoco (The Flight Attendant), Selena Gomez (Only Murders in the Building), Jenna Ortega (Wednesday), Jean Smart (Hacks).</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>In addition to winning Best Musical or Comedy, Jean Smart likewise took home a win for Hacks in 2022. And while she continued to kill it as the brash aging comic Deborah Vance in season two, it would be nice to see a newcomer win in this category — particularly with three women of color to choose from.</p><p data-characters=35 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false><strong>Who we think will win: Jenna Ortega</strong></p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Best Actor in a TV Series, Musical or Comedy</strong></h3><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true><strong>Nominees:</strong> Donald Glover (Atlanta), Bill Hader (Barry), Steve Martin (Only Murders in the Building), Martin Short (Only Murders in the Building), Jeremy Allen White (The Bear).</p><p data-characters=521 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>Now this is a really tough one. On one hand, you’ve got comedy legends Steve Martin and Martin Short. And on the other, there’s Donald Glover, Bill Hader, and Jeremy Allen White, who all gave extremely nuanced dramatic comedy performances. Honestly, you could throw a dart and any of them would be deserving. Will Glover win his third Globe for the fourth and final season of Atlanta, or will Hader win for the first time on his third nomination for Barry? Or will the HFPA pull a real wild card and give it to White?</p><p data-characters=41 data-current-count=41 data-injectable=false><strong>Who we think will win: Jeremy Allen White</strong></p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Best Supporting Actor, Television</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/john-turturro-severance.jpg><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true><strong>Nominees:</strong> John Lithgow (The Old Man), Jonathan Pryce (The Crown), John Turturro (Severance), Tyler James Williams (Abbott Elementary), Henry Winkler (Barry).</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>John Turturro was passed over for an Emmy for his outstanding performance in Severance, but perhaps the HFPA will get things right. He also faces stiff competition from Henry Winkler, who was likewise nominated for an Emmy last year. (Both lost to Brett Goldstein for Ted Lasso.) Likewise, both actors gave phenomenal performances in their respective roles, but we feel certain Turturro has got this.</p><p data-characters=36 data-current-count=36 data-injectable=false><strong>Who we think will win: John Turturro</strong></p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Best Supporting Actress, Television</strong></h3><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false><strong>Nominees:</strong> Elizabeth Debicki (The Crown), Hannah Einbinder (Hacks), Julia Garner (Ozark), Janelle James (Abbott Elementary), Sheryl Lee Ralph (Abbott Elementary).</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true>It seems a little bit unfair to lump comedy and drama together for the best supporting roles, with previous Emmy winners Julia Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph now going head to head. But it would be cool to see Janelle James get recognized for her side-splitting portrayal as principal Ava Coleman in Abbott Elementary, so we’re just going to put our dreams out into the world.</p><p data-characters=36 data-current-count=36 data-injectable=false><strong>Who we think will win: Janelle James</strong></p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Best Limited Series, Anthology Series or a Motion Picture Made for Television</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-white-lotus.jpg><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true><strong>Nominees:</strong> Black Bird (Apple TV), Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story (Netflix), The Dropout (Hulu), Pam & Tommy (Hulu), The White Lotus (HBO).</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story may currently stand as Netflix’s second most-viewed English series of all time, but does it deserve to win a Golden Globe? Readers, we think not. Any of the other series nominated in this category would be more deserving — even Hulu’s fun and mostly unserious Pam & Tommy — but The White Lotus will most likely repeat Emmys history to clinch the win.</p><p data-characters=38 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true><strong>Who we think will win: The White Lotus</strong></p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Best Performance by an Actor, Limited Series, Anthology Series or Motion Picture Made for Television</strong></h3><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false><strong>Nominees:</strong> Taron Egerton (Black Bird), Colin Firth (The Staircase), Andrew Garfield (Under the Banner of Heaven), Evan Peters (Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story), Sebastian Stan (Pam & Tommy).</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>This one will probably also come down to the true crime trifecta of Taron Egerton, Colin Firth, and Andrew Garfield — although all five nominees technically fall under the same genre.

That remains to be seen, but we have a gut feeling.</p><p data-characters=36 data-current-count=36 data-injectable=false><strong>Who we think will win: Taron Egerton</strong></p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Best Performance by an Actress, Limited Series, Anthology Series or a Motion Picture Made for Television</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-dropout.jpg><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true><strong>Nominees:</strong> Jessica Chastain (George and Tammy), Julia Garner (Inventing Anna), Lily James (Pam & Tommy), Julia Roberts (Gaslit), Amanda Seyfried (The Dropout).</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>Can Julia Roberts in the Starz political thriller Gaslit beat out Amanda Seyfried’s gravely-voiced portrayal of Elizabeth Holmes in Hulu’s The Dropout?

And yes, Coolidge’s instantly iconic line of “These gays! They’re trying to murder me!” will not be leaving the pop culture lexicon anytime soon.
