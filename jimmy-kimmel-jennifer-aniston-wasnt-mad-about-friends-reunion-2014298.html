The Friends alum, 45, stopped by Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Wednesday, Aug. 27, and reunited with her sit-com costars <strong><a href=#>Lisa Kudrow</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Courteney Cox</a></strong> for a hilarious sketch — but some fans and viewers didn’t even know Aniston was acting.&nbsp;</p><p>“Of course, we were acting,” <strong><a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel</a></strong> said of the skit on the following day, Thursday, Aug. 28. “It was acting. Everybody knew it was gonna happen, we rehearsed it backstage, it was scripted out. The idea was that I would force Jennifer into this mini Friends reunion, and she pretended to be annoyed by it.”&nbsp;</p><p>In the scene, the late-night host played Ross, and tried to coerce the three women into acting out his fan fiction. Aniston pretended to be annoyed by Kimmel’s request, and walked out on the scene with Kudrow, 51, and Cox, 50.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=350 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Jimmy Kimmel Live - Friends Reunion" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“For some reason, maybe half, if not more, of the people commenting online seemed to think that was real,” Kimmel explained on Live! after fans took to social media to voice their distress about Aniston’s apparent annoyance. “I’m not kidding. There are thousands of comments.”</p><p>Kimmel, 46, went on to read comments from viewers about how the reunion was “awkward,” Aniston seemed “rude,” appeared to have “no fun,” and was “clearly” not acting and visibly upset.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Well, she was acting —&nbsp;apparently very well, too!” Kimmel marveled. “She should probably get an Emmy for that acting.”</p><p>Watch Kimmel quiet the critics in the video above!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGipZ2ueqy1zKacpWWamruvtcWeqWaZnp7AtbvNZq6aq56peq6tw2aYm6elqXqnvsiepZ2rXaeytrrIqKVmamBmgXOFl2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
