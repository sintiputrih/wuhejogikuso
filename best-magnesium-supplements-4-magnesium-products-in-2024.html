The essential mineral plays a role in hundreds of functions throughout the body, including protein synthesis, blood glucose control, muscle and nerve function and blood pressure regulation.</p><p>A deficiency of magnesium can cause nausea and vomiting, muscle spasms, abnormal heart rhythms, constipation and more. If you’re not getting enough magnesium from your diet, the best magnesium supplements can help support numerous body systems and address the symptoms of a deficiency in the vital mineral.</p><h2>Best Magnesium Supplements in 2024</h2><h2>Finding the Best Magnesium Supplements: A Buyer’s Guide</h2><p>When looking for the best magnesium supplement, first you need to consider your individual needs. If you fear you’re not getting enough magnesium in your diet you might want to consider a supplement with a single form of highly absorbable magnesium – like magnesium glycinate – to make up for the magnesium deficiency from your diet. If you’re hoping to improve your overall health and wellness, a supplement with several types of magnesium will help you find balance in both body and mind.</p><p>The overwhelming choice of dietary supplements can be intimidating, so we recommend doing your own research and then discussing with your doctor about the best options for you. The following buyer’s guide will help you figure out what to look for in a magnesium supplement as well as some of our top recommendations.</p><h2>What to Consider When Buying Magnesium Supplements</h2><p>When searching for the best magnesium supplement for you, consider the following factors:</p><h3>Production Process</h3><p>Given that the FDA doesn’t regulate dietary supplements in the same way as drugs, it’s important to choose products from brands that are Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) certified. This means that supplements are produced in facilities that are compliant with manufacturing regulations established by the FDA.</p><h3>Customer Reviews</h3><p>If you’re unsure about a magnesium supplement, head to the customer reviews, just make sure they are from real users and not the often sketchy reviews you see on Amazon. Verified customer reviews provide insights into the effectiveness of a supplement, as well as how well it’s tolerated, its value for money and more.</p><h3>Quality Ingredients</h3><p>When choosing a magnesium supplement, ingredients are probably the most important factor. Look for supplements made with high-quality ingredients and uncomplicated formulations.</p><p>Plus, there are many different types of magnesium, so you’ll want to choose the types that are most appropriate for your needs. For example, magnesium citrate is often used to treat the symptoms of anxiety, while magnesium oxide is believed to be best used for digestive issues.</p><p>Finally, we recommend avoiding products with any artificial ingredients, such as filler, preservatives, colors and flavors.</p><h2>Most Common Types of Magnesium Supplements</h2><p>There are several <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">types of magnesium</a> you’ll find in magnesium supplements, with some types linked to supporting specific health issues. Let’s take a look at the most common forms of magnesium supplements and their uses.</p><h3>Magnesium citrate</h3><p>One of the most common magnesium supplements, magnesium citrate is a form of magnesium that’s bound with citric acid. It’s naturally found in citrus fruits, with the acid being responsible for the tarte flavor.</p><p>It’s believed to be one of the most bioavailable forms – i.e. most easily absorbable – forms of magnesium. Its common use is as a calm agent to help manage the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Magnesium citrate also has a natural laxative effect, so it’s sometimes used at higher doses to treat constipation.</p><h3>Magnesium oxide</h3><p>A salt that combines magnesium and oxygen, magnesium oxide is a white powdery substance often sold in powder or capsule form.</p><p>As this form of magnesium is poorly absorbed by the digestive tract, it is usually used to treat uncomfortable digestive issues, such as indigestion, heartburn and constipation. Magnesium oxide is also sometimes used to prevent and treat migraines.</p><h3>Magnesium glycinate</h3><p>Magnesium is formed from elemental magnesium and the amino acid glycine. This particular amino acid plays an important role in protein construction.</p><p>Magnesium glycinate is easily absorbed and, although more research is needed, it’s believed to have calming properties. Therefore, it may help reduce the symptoms of several mental health issues including depression, anxiety, stress and insomnia.</p><h3>Magnesium chloride</h3><p>Magnesium chloride is a salt that combines magnesium and chlorine. It is well absorbed in the digestive tract, which makes it a great all-around magnesium supplement. It can also be used to boost magnesium levels in those who are deficient in magnesium.</p><p>Magnesium chloride is most frequently found in capsules or tablets, but it can also be found in topicals, designed to help soothe everyday aches and pains.</p><h2>Potential Benefits of Magnesium Supplements</h2><p>Magnesium is involved in more than 300 essential metabolic reactions, including nerve signal transmission, muscle contraction, energy production, blood pressure regulation and so much more.</p><p>Although magnesium is found in high levels in many whole foods such as legumes, seeds, nuts and green leafy vegetables, it’s estimated as many as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">two-thirds of people</a> in the Western world are falling short of their magnesium needs through diet alone.</p><p>Low levels of magnesium may be involved in various health and wellness concerns, such as osteoporosis, migraines, heart disease and more. Therefore, for those who don’t get enough of this vital mineral in their diet, magnesium supplements can have several potential health benefits.</p><h3>Bone health</h3><p>Around 50% to 60% of the body’s magnesium is found within the bones, being responsible for maintaining bone health and protecting against bone loss.</p><p>A <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recent review study</a> found an association between high magnesium intake and increased bone density in bones that are susceptible to fracture. Further research demonstrates higher magnesium intake reduces the risk of bone loss, osteoporosis and fractures.</p><h3>Heart health</h3><p>Magnesium is essential in supporting heart health. A <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2021 review study</a> found that magnesium supplements can help lower high blood pressure, which is a risk factor for heart disease. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Another review study</a> found a link between high magnesium intake and a lower risk of stroke, high blood pressure and heart disease.</p><p>Further research has found that magnesium supplements improve multiple heart disease risk factors including reduced levels of LDL (bad cholesterol), higher levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and lowered blood pressure, particularly in those with a magnesium deficiency.</p><h3>Boost exercise performance</h3><p>Magnesium aids the transport of blood sugar into the muscles and the removal of lactate, which can build up during exercise causing muscle fatigue.</p><p>Research has shown that magnesium supplements can help boost exercise performance, particularly in those who are deficient in the mineral. Plus, magnesium can help to boost muscle power and mass, aid recovery and protect against muscle damage.</p><h3>Anxiety symptoms</h3><p>While current research is limited, early evidence suggests that magnesium supplements have the potential as a treatment for managing anxiety symptoms.</p><p>Furthermore, magnesium plays a key role in brain function and mood, with low levels linked to an increased risk of depression. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Studies indicate</a> that supplementing with magnesium can help reduce the symptoms of depression.</p><h2>Comparing the Best Magnesium Supplements in 2024</h2><h3>Best Overall Magnesium Supplement: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Organixx Magnesium 7</a></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/organixx-2.png alt=Organixx width=975 height=976 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Achieve optimum magnesium levels with Magnesium 7 from Organixx.
