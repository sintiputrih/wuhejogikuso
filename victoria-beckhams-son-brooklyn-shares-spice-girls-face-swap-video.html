Brooklyn, who got <a href=#>engaged</a> to <a href=#><strong>Nicola Peltz</strong> </a>in July 2020, added a laughing GIF of The Simpsons’ character Lisa.</p><p>Brooklyn’s younger sister, <a href=#>Harper</a>, 9, previously <a href=#>paid homage to their mom’s singing career</a>. “When u bump into Mummy Spice,” Victoria captioned an Instagram photo of her daughter flashing a peace sign in front of a throwback photo and autograph. “Girl power.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Victoria-Beckham-Son-Brooklyn-Beckham-Shares-Hilarious-Spice-Girls-Face-Swap-Video-Promo.jpg><p>The fashion designer also shares sons <a href=#>Romeo</a>, 18, and <a href=#>Cruz</a>, 16, with her husband, <a href=#><strong>David Beckham</strong></a>, and told<a href=#> <strong>Seth Meyers</strong></a> in September 2016 that “they’re proud” of her.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“<a href=#>They know the Spice Girls</a>,” Victoria said during the Late Night With Seth Meyers appearance at the time. “They know that Mommy wore the heels and did the pout and point. You know, we’ve watched the movie together, and when I was on tour with the Spice Girls [in 2007], I took the children with me. So they were with us, yeah.”</p><p>Cruz takes the most after his mom. “He’s so musical. And I didn’t even realize that he could sing,” Victoria explained. “He’s always the one that plays football, and he was just sitting in the back of the car one day and he was singing, and I was like, ‘Wow, you can really sing.’ … We are like a traveling circus, our family. We sing, we dance, we do football, we do fashion!”</p><p>As for Harper, she can “run in high heels,” which makes her mom “so proud.” Victoria added, “It was so great to have a girl. The boys are so great with her, and David’s such a great dad. It’s so cute to see him with a little girl. She’s so great and she’s a little tomboy playing in the garden with her brothers playing football, and David as well, but she’s also very girlie. So she loves to play with makeup.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGavoZOpvLO1wGaZnpubna6uv4yspqdlkqe8sLfLsqVmq5iWv6a%2FjKynopuVYrSqvsusZJ%2BZk5p6tMPAqWSvoZSavHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
