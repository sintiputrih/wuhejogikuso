It involves five couples competing in a cash-prize game that uses deepfake technology to blur the line between truth and lies. They are made to watch their partner “cheat” while left to wonder if it is just AI technology or if they are really being unfaithful. Isabel Bermejo and Ruben Correia were one of these duos.</p><p style=text-align:left>In this writing which is mostly about Isabel Bermejo, we shall tell you all about Isabel and also about her and Ruben’s journey on the show.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Netflix Deep Fake Love: Are Isabel Bermejo And Ruben Correia Still Together?</strong></h3><p>So, in the show that was filmed in the Dominican Republic, we see Ruben, a digital creator, propose to Isabel, also simply known as Isa, after finding that “magical connection” with her. During their introduction, Isabel also admitted to having “a little bit of fear” about being a participant in a show like this. But then, she also right away assured viewers that she and Ruben can be one hundred percent themselves together.</p><p>So, when Isabel and Ruben decided to test their relationship on&nbsp;Deep Fake Love, they had been together for 8 months. Also, it was said, their connection has been magical from the first minute, Ruben, a sports and fitness instructor, asked her to marry her, right away after he met her.</p><p>As of July 2023 though, it was not known if or not Isabel and Ruben are still together. Back in May and June of 2022, they almost routinely showed people their beautiful pictures. Later, in September that year, Ruben had taken to his IG <a href=#>@rbncorreia_13</a> (among 52.5K followers) to write “there is nothing better than being able to share passion and goals with the person you love” next to their intimate glimpses from gym workouts.</p><p>To those of you who don’t know, Isabel is a single mother. She has a daughter who turned 6 years old on 16 January 2023. A year ago on his birthday, Isabel took to her social media to tell everyone how 5 years ago the love of her life was born. Another time, she was also seen promising her “little self, princess, bun” that she will continue teaching her to misbehave and do mischief.</p><p>Had Isabel and Ruben stood the test of time and the challenges that came their way throughout the competition, they would have been crowned the winners. Also, they would have taken home a grand cash prize.</p><p>Manuel and Aida, Angel and Gabriela, Paula and Javi, and Alejandro and Ramon also joined Isabel and Ruben in the reality show to make the whopping 100,000 euros theirs.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Isabel Bermejo Age</strong></h3><p>Isabel Bermejo was born in 1988.
