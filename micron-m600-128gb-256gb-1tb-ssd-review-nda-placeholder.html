On the one hand I am happy to see that Micron is showing its commitment to the client market by investing on features like Dynamic Write Acceleration because to be honest, Micron has not really introduced anything new to its client SSDs since the M500. Innovation in the client segment is difficult because the market is so cost driven and even though a pseudo-SLC cache is nothing new, Micron's way of implementing it is.</p><p>On the other hand, I am a bit disappointed by the performance of the M600 and especially Dynamic Write Acceleration. In theory Dynamic Write Acceleration sounds great because it should provide the maximum acceleration capacity under every circumstance and thus maximize performance, but the truth is that the speed improvements over the MX100 are minimal. Add to that the fact that the M600 is actually outperformed by the 840 EVO, which utilizes TLC NAND with smaller SLC caches. It is not like the M600 is a slow or bad drive, not at all; it is just that I expected a bit more given the combination of MLC NAND and dynamic SLC cache.</p><p>The positive side of Dynamic Write Acceleration is the increased endurance. While 72TB was without a doubt enough for average client workloads, it is never a bad thing to have more. Especially OEMs tend to appreciate higher endurance because it is associated with higher reliability, and it also opens a wider market for the M600 as it can be used in workstation setups without having to worry about drives wearing out. Of course, I would pick a faster drive like 850 Pro for workstation use, but for OEMs the cost tends to be more important.</p><p>Since the M600 is an OEM-only product, it will not be available through the usual retail channels. Thus the pricing will depend highly on the quantity ordered, so the prices in the above table are just approximate prices for orders of one that Micron provided us. The M600 enjoys a price premium over the MX100, but I suspect that in high volumes the M600 pricing should drop close to the MX100 levels, perhaps even lower.</p><p>All in all, I would have liked to see Micron going after Samsung's 850 Pro and SanDisk's Extreme Pro with the M600, but I do see the logic behind sticking to the high volume mainstream market. In terms of performance, features, and price, the M600 is a solid product and I am certain that PC OEMs will see the appeal in MLC NAND and high endurance over competitors' TLC offerings, especially in the more professional-oriented PC segments.</p><p>It will nevertheless be interesting to see how the separation of retail and OEM product teams plays out for Micron. I am eager to see whether Micron can optimize Dynamic Write Acceleration for heavier workloads and finally provide competition in the high-end SSD market as well. For now, this is a good first step, but it might take a revision or two before Dynamic Write Acceleration can reach its full potential.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIV2fpdopKKboqS7brmVaWdmaWJttKN5kW5toJpdZsGjedKsm2aqlau2psOMp5uaZaChrqSxx6ijnZ2iZIU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
