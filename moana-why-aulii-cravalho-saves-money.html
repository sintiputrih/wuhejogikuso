But thanks to the way the film blew up and fast became a Disney favorite, the soon-to-be-star encountered plenty of professional opportunities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Moana was a huge first for Disney</a>, showcasing demigods with tats and a girl-power lead character who doesn't fall in love by the time the credits run. But it was also Auli'i's breakout role, leading to sitcom appearances and countless other roles.</p><p>And although Auli'i wasn't paid nearly as much as rockstar actor Dwayne Johnson, she did make a modest amount from filming. And, she saved&nbsp;all of it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How Much Dwayne Johnson Was Paid For 'Moana'</a></span></p><p>But why does a gal who's just gotten her break in Hollywood need to save every penny she earns? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a> confirmed that Auli'i admitted to saving all of her money for a very real purpose: her future.</p><p>Though she's now enjoying a starring role on 'Rise,' Cravalho doesn't want to take her chances. After all, she grew up pretty poor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As&nbsp;CNBC quoted, Auli'i said of her childhood, "I’m not used to having a lot…. I grew up in really humble beginnings on a small island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean." That's enough reason to save her pennies.</p><p>But Cravalho elaborated, "I knew that if my mom brought home white bread, we were like, in it big. We were going to be okay for the next month."</p><p>When she spoke with&nbsp;CNBC, Auli'i was still in high school and was only 17. A few years later, she's now in college, and that's precisely why she's been socking away her cash: for her future.</p><p>If roles stop coming her way, Auli'i knows she's got her bank account to back her family up. She even said, "I have not treated myself with any of my paychecks at all," as she was preparing to apply to colleges.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, acting remained front and center for the starlet: she wants to pursue college on either the West or East coast of the US for more acting opportunities.&nbsp;When it comes to fan theories about&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Disney princesses and their appropriate majors</a>, Auli'i's Moana better be on the list!</p><p>It could take some time, though, as the pandemic threw a wrench in Auli'i's plans. She did make the move to Los Angeles, in her first place on her own,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Times</a> confirmed in a recent interview,&nbsp;but was focusing on work for the time being. And fans should be thrilled: the actress just debuted in a real-live film,&nbsp;and she sings in it, too.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Auli'i Cravalho's Been Up To Since 'Moana'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikqJmelnq4tNhmmK6kmZ56pL7Ar5iloJ9iwKLCxKxkpqeemsZw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
