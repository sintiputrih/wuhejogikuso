One of the most notable cast members of the show was Sophia Bush, who played the fierce and independent Brooke Davis. Since the show ended, Bush has been up to quite a lot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only has she continued to act in various TV shows and movies, but she has also become an advocate for political and social issues. She has been using her platform to speak out on important topics such as women’s rights, environmental conservation, and social justice. Her activism has even led her to <a href=#>consider running for office one day</a>.</p><p>Despite her busy schedule, Bush has also managed to maintain a close relationship with some of her former One Tree Hill co-stars. She often posts pictures with them on social media, and they even attended her wedding to <a href=#>her fiancé Grant Hughes</a> in June 2022. Fans of the show will be happy to know that Bush particularly still holds her friendships with Hilarie Burton and Bethany Joy Lenz close to her heart.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sophia Bush Has Received Death Threats For Her Political Opinions</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, not all relationships from the series have remained positive. Bush has had a history of strained relations between her and Chad Michael Murray. Not only is the Riverdale actor her former co-star on One Tree Hill, <a href=#>the pair were also briefly married</a> in 2005.</p><h2 id=sophia-bush-and-chad-michael-murray-were-romantically-involved-on-and-off-screen>Sophia Bush And Chad Michael Murray Were Romantically Involved On And Off-Screen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Sophia-Bush-and-Chad-Michael-Murray.jpg><p>Sophia Bush and Chad Michael Murray met for the first time on the set of One Tree Hill. They featured in the then-WB drama series as Brooke Davis and Lucas Scott respectively. Brooke started out as a popular, but self-centered cheerleader who often clashed with the other people. She would however, go on to evolve into one of the most beloved characters on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Murray’s Lucas was introduced in the first season as a talented basketball player who is also an aspiring writer. He was depicted as having a very good heart and being loyal to his friends and family. Brooke and Lucas dated for a time in the story, although they eventually broke up and each ended up marrying different people.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Chad Michael Murray’s Life Changed In Dramatic Ways Following His One Tree Hill Fame</a></span></p><p>In real life, Bush and Murray took things to the next level. They had not known each other for very long when they started dating, and eventually decided to get married in April 2005. But just like their characters’ relationship on screen, they did not last long off it, and they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">got officially divorced</a> after just five months.</p><h2 id=what-happened-between-sophia-bush-and-chad-michael-murray>What Happened Between Sophia Bush And Chad Michael Murray?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chad-michael-murray-and-sophia-bush-had-their-marriage-annulled.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The marriage between Sophia Bush and Chad Michael Murray was so short-lived that some people speculated that they had curated the entire thing <a href=#>as a publicity stunt</a>. While this is perhaps pushing the narrative a little too far, the actress has since admitted that she did not want to get into the marriage in the first place.</p><p>“Everybody’s been 22 and stupid,” Bush said when she appeared on SiriusXM’s Radio Andy with Andy Cohen in June 2018. “It was not a thing I actually really wanted to do. Ladies have to learn how to take up space in a way men are taught they are entitled to!” She insisted that she had felt pressured to take the major step, albeit not necessarily by Murray himself (or alone).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sophia Bush Admits She Ghosted Rihanna On 'The Drew Barrymore Show'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In this kind of environment, it stands to reason that the marriage was not destined to last very long. In fact, things got so messy between them that at one point, Bush attempted not just to divorce Murray, but to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have their union annulled</a> in the first place.</p><h2 id=sophia-bush-has-ldquo-nothing-good-to-say-rdquo-to-chad-michael-murray>Sophia Bush Has “Nothing Good To Say” To Chad Michael Murray</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Sophia-Bush-And-Chad-Michael-Murray.jpg><p>In any industry in the world, it cannot be an easy thing to continue working with someone <a href=#>after you have broken up</a> with them. This is particularly true in Hollywood, where two exes may be required to actually keep playing lovers on screen. Sophia Bush and Chad Michael Murray, however, found a way to continue existing on the set of One Tree Hill even after their divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If anything, the negatives she found from working with her ex were not Murray’s fault, but that of the producers on the show. Speaking to Dax Shepard on his Armchair Podcast in December 2018, Bush revealed that some of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">producers had been preying on the issues</a> she was facing with her ex and using them to build the One Tree Hill storylines.</p><p>In a separate and earlier conversation, she was asked whether she still remains in touch with Murray. “That's such an interesting question,” Bush responded. “But my mother once said to me that if you don’t have anything nice to say, not to say anything at all.” On her brief nuptials to her former co-star she added: “We were two stupid kids who had no business being in a relationship in the first place.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqqKiYnq5urtSsn2aqlZvCtLHDZquoZZOkuq6xza1kqKZdmLWisIymoJygkZq5brnUq6masV2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1urcWtnKtln6OybsDRnpxmoJmhuXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
