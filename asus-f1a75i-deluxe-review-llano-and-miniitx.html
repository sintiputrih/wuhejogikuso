As I write, ASUS are still on the release BIOS for the F1A75-I Deluxe, which is what I have here, and it works as it should with no issues.</p><p>I should point out that as this board has not been released, the BIOS is technically still not an official release. &nbsp;This will most likely change in the near future.</p><p>The front page represents the easy mode of BIOS tuning, detailing all the important information every manufacturer should give on the front page – the board name, the BIOS version, the CPU and CPU frequency, total memory and speed, temperatures, voltages and fan speeds.&nbsp; The system performance option allows users to apply preset ASUS settings for low power, standard, or enhanced performance.&nbsp; Also, users can adjust the boot priority using the drag and drop icons at the bottom, or boot from a selected device with a double click. &nbsp;One thing I did notice is that my USB device that was selectable later on in the BIOS was not present in this boot priority menu.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/4833/1-EZ_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>For more detailed options, users must navigate to the advanced mode, which gives a more standard BIOS feel to it.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/4833/2-Main_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The AI Tweaker menus give the overclock options.&nbsp; Left on automatic (in normal power mode on the easy BIOS screen), these will default to stock settings – including my memory at DDR3-1333 and CL9, despite it being rated much faster.&nbsp; With memory being an important factor in Llano graphics, and the A75 platform, currently released processors will support DDR3-1600 or DDR3-1866 - there is rather an elaborate way of implementing XMP on this board, by selecting the DOCP profile and navigating through a submenu.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/4833/3-AITweaker_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Along with the overclock and memory options, all of which are fully featured, the voltage section allows either an offset to be applied, or a selectable value. &nbsp;There are no options to change any of the integrated graphics clock settings, however.&nbsp; This has to be done in the operating system using Catalyst software.</p><p><i><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/4833/13-TemperatureMonitor_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></i></p><p>The fan settings for the two onboard headers are adjustable through the UEFI or in the operating system – any setting made in the UEFI will make its way into the OS software for manual graphic manipulation.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/4833/8-SATAConfig_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>On default settings, the SATA configuration will revert to IDE mode.&nbsp; I can see that there are various reasons for being in IDE mode automatically for compatibility, though I would hazard a guess and say the users of this board will most likely be using relatively newer SATA drives and an AHCI compatible operating system, meaning I would prefer AHCI by default and the extra performance it gives.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/4833/10-NBConfig_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The integrated graphics part of the BIOS can force the on chip graphics, even when a discrete GPU is present (presumably for GPU simulation/OpenCL), or when the discrete GPU can be put into CrossFireX with the integrated graphics for improved performance.&nbsp; Here we can also set the memory reserved for the integrated GPU, in predefined levels up to 2 GB.</p><p><strong>Overclocking</strong></p><p>If this board were to have a serious issue, from the perspective of functionality beyond specifications, it would be the overclocking.</p><p>In terms of automatic overclocking features, the BIOS has the OC Tuner option, and the OS has software which enables a ‘Fast’ OC and an ‘Extreme’ OC.&nbsp; In my experience, the OC Tuner and ‘Fast’ options performed similarly, giving a 3% overclock in the base clock from 100 MHz to 103 MHz.&nbsp; Memory frequency similarly received a 3% bump, rather than applying the inbuilt XMP profiles which I would have expected.</p><p>The ‘extreme’ preset is a more aggressive form of overclock, configuring and testing the system until a suitable maximum is reached.&nbsp; When this button is clicked (for a non-black edition Llano CPU), the base clock is adjusted up 1 MHz at a time, stress tested for a short time, and at every multiple of 10 MHz the system restarts.&nbsp; On previous platforms, I have had no issue with this preset – usually it has applied more voltage than ideal, but it works well in the majority of situations.&nbsp; Here however, there is a slight problem.&nbsp; After going up to 110 MHz, the system rebooted, and failed to recover.&nbsp; Upon loading Windows, it would blue screen (with the characteristic of a failed overclock), and end up in restart loop.&nbsp; In the end, I manually had to reduce the BIOS speed to 107 MHz to get a successful OS start up.</p><p>In terms of manual overclocking, this is fairly straight forward.&nbsp; I manually increased the CPU voltage to 1.5 V, the memory voltage to 1.65 V, and adjusted the base clock.&nbsp; However, I could not get the machine to boot above 107 MHz.&nbsp; No matter what settings I used (included a set which ASUS gave me involving adjusting the CPU current limits), the 107 MHz barrier would not be breached.</p><p>Overclocking in the operating system was a different matter altogether.&nbsp; Using the ASUS Suite II software, when using a discrete GPU, I could happily adjust the base clock to 120 MHz under stock voltage and it was stable through 2D and 3D tests.&nbsp; Unfortunately this setting is not kept between boots, and requires manual application every time.&nbsp; While using the integrated graphics, using this method, I could not go beyond 110 MHz.</p><p>As a result of this situation it is almost impossible to recommend this board as an overclocking board.&nbsp; Due to the design and low profile nature, I would be happier running this board at stock, but users will have to manually adjust the memory speed to something more useful for the Llano processor.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong></p><p>I approached ASUS with this issue regarding the overclocking.&nbsp; They suggested that I may get a better overclock when using IDE mode for my SATA ports rather than my default of using AHCI to keep the SATA port testing equivalent.</p><p>In IDE mode, overclocking is a different story.&nbsp; While on the discrete GPU, I was able to boot at 140 MHz no trouble, effectively moving from 2600 MHz to 3640 MHz, with all settings in the BIOS on auto.&nbsp; 145 MHz caused similar OS booting issues to AHCI mode beyond 105 MHz, but a 40% overclock is a brilliant result to get.</p><p>Using DDR3-2133 MHz memory (9-11-9), at 140 MHz, the BIOS settings gave me a choice of DDR3-1866 and DDR3-2240 speeds on their respective dividers.&nbsp; With the memory subtimings set at auto, only DDR3-1866 worked, with 9-9-9 subtimings being applied automatically.&nbsp; I was able to boot at DDR3-2240 if I loosened the subtimings, but DDR3-1866 CL9 represents a standard Llano kit that people would buy and it managed this easily.</p><p>By using ASUS’ recommended settings, and bumping up the CPU voltage beyond that given at 140 MHz by the Auto setting, I was unable to improve on 140 MHz as an overclock, which leaves 140 MHz a good benchmark for this processor.</p><p>In terms of pure throughput, this 3640 MHz setting gave a boost in 3DPM from 66.27 to 93.42 in single threaded mode, and from 224.68 to 315.21 in multithreaded mode.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/valid.canardpc.com/cache/screenshot/2012786.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>(CPU-Z does not correctly record the Bus Speed yet,&nbsp;<br>however the overall Core Speed is correct.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIF5f5JomKyto2Kzcq2WbqBmnJWhwrmxjKucr6GVrHqtuMCnpmaZnpl6rrXNoqCtsF9n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
