A few of them — <a href=#><strong>Leighton Meester</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Chace Crawford</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Taylor Momsen</strong></a> — even break into giant, cheesy smiles. <a href=#><strong>Blake Lively</strong></a>, who played Serena van der Woodsen, doesn’t grin, instead attempting a kind of “intimidating mean girl” look.</p><a title=@kimad21 href=#>@kimad21</a><p><a title=greenscreenvideo href=#>#greenscreenvideo</a> WHOEVER FOUND THIS IS A GOD (credit at the end for her account) <a title=gossipgirl href=#>#gossipgirl</a> <a title=gg href=#>#gg</a> <a title=tvd href=#>#tvd</a> <a title=serenavanderwoodsen href=#>#serenavanderwoodsen</a> <a title=chuckbass href=#>#chuckbass</a> <a title=WorthTheWait href=#>#WorthTheWait</a></p><p><a title="♬ original sound - Madk" href=#>♬ original sound – Madk</a></p><p>In a <a href=#>tweet</a> posted on Monday, April 19, user @blairhumphry wrote, “HELP THIS WAS ALMOST THE OPENING CREDITS FOR GOSSIP GIRL.” TikTok caught up two days later, after @kimad21 shared a video of her reaction to the clip.</p><p>“Why does Chuck look like he’s supposed to be on <a href=#>Twilight</a>,” asked one commenter of <strong><a href=#>Ed Westwick’s</a></strong> slouchy look. “Jenny really did that Hannah Montana intro turn,” added another. As several users pointed out, the video also includes a misspelling of Crawford’s first name: “Chase” instead of “Chace.”</p><p>For the real intro, show creators went with a 10-second clip that didn’t feature any names or actors, instead settling on a narration by <a href=#><strong>Kristen Bell</strong></a> who famously ended with, “You know you love me. XOXO, Gossip Girl.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/OMG-Did-TikTok-Just-Uncover-An-Alternate-Gossip-Girl-Intro-Promo.jpg><p>The song “Glamorous,” however, did feature in the show later on, though not in the opening credits. In the third episode of season 1, Jenny and the school choir sang an a cappella version of the track over a montage of various characters prepping for a school visit from college representatives.</p><p>It remains to be seen what kind of intro will end up on <a href=#>the HBO Max reboot of the show</a>, set to debut later this year, but some fans hope it’ll be more like the soapy clip unearthed by social media than the minimalist one used from the show’s original 2007-2012 run.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Also titled Gossip Girl, the new series will follow a new set of private school students and is executive produced by the original show’s cocreators, <strong>Josh Schwartz</strong> and <strong>Stephanie Savage</strong>.</p><p>Showrunner <a href=#><strong>Joshua Safran</strong></a> has said that the show will take place in the same universe as the original but pick up in the present day. He has also promised that the cast and characters will be more inclusive.</p><p>“This time around the leads are nonwhite,” he said at the <a href=#>Vulture Festival</a> in November 2019. “There’s a lot of queer content on this show. It is very much dealing with the way the world looks now, where wealth and privilege come from, and how you handle that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJilrJWnu6LAxGaeqKujnr1us8iro2ahnqm%2FsHnGqJysZaaev6K4jKilZqyZoMGwt4ytrqKspJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
