Throughout her time on the show, Brown saw Connie through a series of life changes, including leaving her job at Firehouse 51 to become a counselor.&nbsp;</p><p>Like her co-star Christian Stolte, DuShon Monique Brown was <a href=#>best known for a recurring role on "Prison Break"</a> before she was cast on "Chicago Fire." She played Nurse Katie Welch, friend and coworker of Sara, for 13 episodes of the hit show.</p><p>However, it was on "Chicago Fire" that she found her biggest success. The actor told <a href=#>Hidden Remote</a>, "I'm just this goofy, nerdy, violin-playing, singing goofy songs with my kid, tree-hugging, sometimes foul-mouthed Chicagoan who plays the violin, likes karaoke, embraces the trees, loves to be appreciated for her work, and dreams of playing a superhero in the movies."</p><p>Unfortunately, Brown passed away in 2018. Per the <a href=#>Chicago Tribune</a>, the show paid tribute through an emotional scene where Firehouse 51 is informed that Connie has moved away to fulfill her dreams. "I didn't get a chance to say goodbye,"&nbsp;said David Eigenberg's character Christopher, speaking for the other characters as well as the cast. On social media, her co-stars honored Brown when they heard the news. Kara Killmer <a href=#>tweeted</a>, "Your lovingkindness and understanding have been a safe place of great importance to me. I will always love you. I miss you."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2pgboZ4e8eeqZ6rXay1pr7EZrCorV2gu7DDjK2fnmWTlsC1ec6fZJygmZiuqLuMn6CrnV2bv7C5jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
