When they made out at Craig's in West Hollywood during a triple date with Haylie Duff and her then-boyfriend Matt Rosenberg and Ali Fedotowsky and her husband Kevin Manno (the other two couples were also kissing). Needless to say, it made for a great photo that Cuoco shared in a now-deleted post on Instagram,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>per&nbsp;E!
