For some reason, a lot of women feel societal pressure on their shoulders to bear children. Some women don’t want to have kids simply because they don’t want to go through the process of childbirth due to the potential factor that a woman might not survive childbirth. Some women really love their bodies and don’t want to see their bodies change.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Celebs Who Keep Their Kids Hidden From The Public</a></span></p><p class=p1>Some women love having freedom with their time and energy; they know that having a child would mean that their freedom is no longer really available. Some women don’t want to bring kids into the world because the world is filled with major issues like pandemics, diseases, corruption, and more. Some women prefer to experience life with their significant others in a way that allows them to focus solely on their romantic relationship, rather than having to also focus on raising kids on top of that.</p><h2 id=ren-e-zellweger><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Renée Zellweger</span></h2><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The London Times</a>&nbsp;in 2008&nbsp;<a href=#>Renée Zellweger</a> said,&nbsp;"Motherhood has never been an ambition. I don't think like that. I never have expectations like 'when I'm 19 I'm going to do this, and by the time I've hit 25 I'm going to do that'. I just take things as they come, each day at a time, and if things happen, all well and good. I just want to be independent and be able to take care of myself. Anything else is just gravy." As time passed on for Renee,&nbsp;her lack of childbearing expectations continued on as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chelsea-handler><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Chelsea Handler</span></h2><p>During a conversation with Amanda De Cadenet, <a href=#>Chelsea Handler</a> explained, "I definitely don't want to have kids. I don't think I'd be a great mother. I don't want to have a kid and have it raised by a nanny. I don't have the time to raise a child myself." Her reasons are valid. Her level of fame means that she probably spends a lot of time very busy handling a packed-out schedule of tasks.</p><h2 id=dita-von-teese><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Dita Von Teese</span></h2><p>Back in 2007, Dita Von Tesse explained why having kids is not for her. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She said</a>, "I was married to someone who was not cut-out to be a father. He could hardly take care of himself, let alone a child, so I changed my views, adapted accordingly, thought: It's okay not to have children. Now I'm just going to watch how my life unfolds and see what happens. I'm not going to be less of a person if I don't have children. It will work out the way it is supposed to." It is 100% okay not to have kids and not to want them either-- regardless of the reasoning behind it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alison-brie><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Alison Brie</span></h2><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Times of London</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;Alison Brie had a lot to say about kids in 2018. She said,&nbsp;"I don't really want to have kids. It's great because I don't worry about when I should get pregnant—between seasons, while we're shooting the show [Glow]—I don't think about it every day."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Dave Franco And Alison Brie Wrote A Romantic Comedy In Just Two Weeks</a></span></p><p>She continued, "It would be nice, but I think of all the things that would be so stressful. I think about how much we're involved in our cats' lives. Oh my God, if it was a child!" She has been married to Dave Franco since 2017.</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Miley Cyrus</span></h2><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ELLE</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> US</a>&nbsp;two years ago in 2019, <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> said, "We've been doing the same thing to the earth that we do to women. We just take and take and expect it to keep producing. And it's exhausted. It can't produce. We're getting handed a piece-of-sh** planet, and I refuse to hand that down to my child. Until I feel like my kid would live on earth with fish in the water, I'm not bringing in another person to deal with that." She cares about the future generations and knows that things on this planet (environmentally) aren't looking too great.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stevie-nicks><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Stevie Nicks</span></h2><p>Stevie Nicks is an iconic musician who has been beloved for years. She decided to focus on her career as a musician rather than motherhood pretty early on. She said, "It's like, Do you want to be an artist and a writer, or a wife and a lover? With kids, your focus changes. I don't want to go to PTA meetings." (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">InStyle</a>.) Her choice not to have kids worked out for her. These days, she's released new music with the likes of <a href=#>Lana Del Rey</a> and Miley Cyrus!</p><h2 id=sarah-silverman><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Sarah Silverman</span></h2><p><a href=#>Sarah Silverman</a> posted this super honest note to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>: "As a comic always working & on the road I have had to decide between motherhood & living my fullest life & I chose the latter."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Sarah Silverman Is Angry At Hollywood For This Reason</a></span></p><p>Some women can balance career life with motherhood but some women don't believe it's the right route for them personally. Being fulfilled within a career and finding passion in life through being successful is enough for a lot of people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=marisa-tomei><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Marisa Tomei</span></h2><p>In an interview with<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Manhattan Magazine</a> in 2009, Marisa Tomei said, "I don't know why women need to have children to be seen as complete human beings." Women are fully complete human beings whether they choose to have kids or not. Having a child does not complete you! Society has pressured many women into thinking that but it is simply not the truth at all.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jennifer Lawrence</span></h2><a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a> &nbsp;told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!</a> that she used to care about motherhood but those sentiments dwindled away as time progressed. She said, "When I was 21 or 22 I was like, 'I can't wait to be a mother. Now I'm like...[shocked face]. They are actually getting less and less as I get older, which is starting to worry me. I don't think that's how it's supposed to work!" She probably realized how much fun life is without having to take on such a huge responsibility. <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-aniston><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jennifer Aniston</span></h2><p>One of the most famous childless celebs out there would have to be Jennifer Aniston. She said on&nbsp;the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today Show</a>, "I don't have this sort of checklist of things that have to be done and if they're not checked then I've failed some part of my feminism or my being a woman or my worth or my value as a woman… Y' know, I've birthed a lot of things. I feel like I've mothered many things. And I don't think it's fair to put that pressure on people." She had this interview back in 2014 and she obviously still feels the same way now. She lived an amazing, beautiful, fulfilling life. Kids didn't need to be involved for her to become more valuable.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Celebrity Kids Who Are More Famous Than Their Parents</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoylmLCqlaOwpnnOrZ%2Beql2Ysq2xwaugrbFdrLyusc1mrqGnXZm8r8CMnJirnV2pvG60wK%2BcZqOZmcBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
