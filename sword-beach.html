Five sections of the Normandy shoreline were chosen for the invasion and codenamed: Gold, Sword Beach, Omaha, Utah, and Juno.</p><p>Taking control of Sword Beach was crucial in protecting the eastern flank from the possibility of a German armored counterattack. The Allies’ subsequent victory at Sword Beach spelled the beginning of their triumph over Nazi Germany in all of Europe and the Western Front in less than a year.</p><h2>Coming Ashore Sword Beach</h2><p>Codenamed Operation Neptune or Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy, now known as D-Day, was the most massive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">amphibious invasion</a> in history — and perhaps the most significant turning point for the Allies during World War II as their victory there laid the foundation for the Nazis’ defeat.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-222111 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sword-beach-d-day-wounded.jpg alt="Soldier Wounded On Sword Beach" width=900 height=674 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-222111 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>British soldiers transport a wounded comrade in the area of Sword Beach. June 1944.</span></p><p>Author and historian Giles Milton spoke about the magnitude of the invasion during a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2018 BBC podcast</a>. “The statistics are massive. You can’t begin to get your head around them,” he began. “Seven thousand big ships were involved; 12,000 planes were involved, and on D-Day itself, 156,000 men were due to be landed on those beaches… Nothing like this had ever been attempted before in the history of warfare.”</p>This is the way it was, up close on June 5, 1944, as the greatest invasive force in military history left the south coast of England, bound for the coast of France.<p>The British led the attacks at sections of the shoreline codenamed Gold Beach, the Americans at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Omaha Beach</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Utah Beach</a>, and the Canadians at Juno. Allied troops landing on Sword Beach, the easternmost point of the attacks, were also the responsibility of the British Army along with elements from the Polish, Norwegian and other Allied naval forces.</p><p>“Nobody dashed ashore. We staggered,” Cpl. Peter Masters, a survivor of the Battle of Sword Beach, recalled. “With one hand I carried my gun, finger on the trigger; with the other, I held onto the rope-rail down the ramp, and with the third hand I carried my bicycle.”</p><p>Ordered by his superiors to “get off the beach,” Masters did his best to comply. On the way off the beach, he noticed a couple of soldiers digging a foxhole in the water. “I could never figure out why they were doing that. Being a beginner, I did not know enough to be really frightened.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-222113 alt="British Troops Before The Normandy INvasion" width=900 height=616 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/british-troops-before-d-day.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-222113 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>British paratroopers pose with their toy mascot “Pegasus” just before commencing the Normandy invasion.

The Allies had four objectives here:</p><ul><li>To capture the two bridges that would lead the troops off of Sword Beach and onwards towards Caen.</li><li>To destroy the bridges over the Dives River so as to prevent the Germans from counterattacking on the eastern side.</li><li>To then take control of the areas near the Orne and Dives Rivers.</li><li>Finally, to destroy the fort at Merville which was close to Sword Beach and where a large quantity of Germans troops was stationed.</li></ul><p>In short, the Allies needed to take control of the city of Caen while warding off the Germans in order to advance inland and then fan out to the east and west with the ultimate goal of retaking Paris — and then all of France.</p><h2>A Big Victory At Little Cost</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-222116 alt="Sword Beach Under Fire" width=900 height=684 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sword-beach-under-fire.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-222116 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Infantry of the British 2nd Army Division wait to move off Sword Beach while under enemy fire on the morning of June 6, 1944.</span></p><p>Units of the British 2nd Army along with French commandos first landed on Sword Beach at 7:25 a.m. led by Lt. Gen. Miles Dempsey. Additionally, they were supported by paratroopers who landed in zones located a short distance inland from the beach.</p><p>German defenses were much lighter at Sword Beach than at other landing sectors such as Omaha Beach and by 8:00 a.m., most of the fighting on the beach was concluded. At about 9:30 a.m., two squadrons of Royal Engineers had cleared seven of the eight intended exit lanes from Sword Beach.</p>Archive video footage of the D-Day landings at Normandy on June 6, 1944.<p>It was from Sword Beach that British commandos under Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, found fame. His men were given the task of moving swiftly off the beach and joining up with the paratroopers who had landed inland. They experienced strong German resistance outside the nearby town of Ouistreham but eventually overcame. By 1:00 p.m., the British and French commandos had linked up with the paratroopers and were en route further inland to take the city of Caen. The city of Caen, however, would not be successfully taken in its entirety until mid-July. By then, the city was entirely destroyed.</p><p>The troops moving inland were briefly halted by the only German counterattack of the day which they successfully thwarted. By the end of the day, about 29,000 men had landed at Sword Beach, the beach itself had been secured, and allied forces had advanced about four miles inland. The British saw only around 680 fatalities.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-222125 alt="Princess Elizabeth Watches Airborne Troops" width=900 height=620 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/princess-elizabeth-airborne-troops.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-222125 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>HRH Princess Elizabeth watching parachutists dropping during a visit to airborne forces in England in the run-up to D-Day.
