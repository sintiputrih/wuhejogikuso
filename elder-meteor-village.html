One of those ancient folk tasked with passing down the knowledge of Mega Evolution—with the great lore of Lord Rayquaza, who was the beginning of all."</i> <i>"Since times long gone, Hoenn has repeatedly suffered great disasters. At times, the destruction took the form of a huge meteoroid, which fell upon our land from distant space. At other times, the Primal Reversion of our own super-ancient Pokémon brought us to the brink of destruction. Each time, Lord Rayquaza has saved us from doom. The chosen Lorekeeper, standing before a stone that shone with rainbow light, offered up a wish to the great one. And Lord Rayquaza's body was suffused with a brilliant light and transformed. In its transformed state, Rayquaza's power was more devastating than ever before, overcoming even the super-ancient Pokémon with all their primal power."</i> <i>"Yes, it does indeed. A Pokémon, a person, a stone of power. The bonds that tie them all together... The transformation of the Pokémon that occurs as a result of this phenomenon was called 'Mega Evolution</i> by later peoples."<i></i> <i>"The Lorekeeper is the one who has inherited the knowledge and power to summon Lord Rayquaza when disaster imperils the world. The true Lorekeeper of the current generation is the one called Zinnia. The disaster that now approaches our planet, as it has twice before... Zinnia has been trying for some time to avert it... in her own way. To draw Rayquaza to our sphere, she joined a <a href=# title="Team Magma">certain</a> <a href=# title="Team Aqua">organization</a> that sought to revive the super-ancient Pokémon. She taught them the secrets needed to bring back these threats and summon the great Dragon itself. And now it seems she travels the land, scouring the world for Key Stones..."</i> <i>"Balance must rule this world. History is doomed to repeat itself... While our people have overcome many disasters in the past, it was through great, great sacrifice... Yet we have continued to struggle to preserve peace for as many years as we can. This is how we have protected this world, upon which we now live. People... Pokémon... All nature... And, yes, even you. I do not know exactly what you plan to do. But do you believe that you are not sacrificing anything for your own protection? Zinnia will follow her convictions until the very end. Even knowing the sacrifices that they will require. Even if the sacrificial blade is leveled at her own heart."</i><ul><li>If talked to after Steven leaves</li></ul><i>"That silver-haired dreamboat said he was headed back to <a href=# title="Rustboro City">Rustboro</a>."</i><ul><li>At the end of the Delta Episode</li></ul><i>"Zinnia, my child. ...You have worked so hard."</i> <i>"...It is enough, child. ...Be done with your burden. Let it go now. For everything there must be an ending. Only then... Only then can there be a new beginning. This is immutable truth that all living things on this planet, great and small, must accept. We Draconids have seen it in our history, as you have seen it in your own life. Now is the time for rest. Let down the great burden you have borne so long alone... So that you might at last take a step forward toward a new life. Now is the time for rest..."</i><ul><li>If talked to after completing the Delta Episode</li></ul><i>"Child, you... I heard of what happened from Zinnia. The Draconids owe you much. Zinnia has gone on a journey. A journey to find herself this time. Ah, yes... She did leave this for you, though. I hope you will accept it.."</i> <i>"Hmm... Do you want to teach Dragon Ascent to your Pokémon?"</i> <b>No</b>: <i>"Hmm... I see. Come back anytime you need my help."</i> <b>Yes</b>: <i>"Which Pokémon do you want me to teach the move?"</i> <i>"Dragon Ascent is a powerful move that only Rayquaza can use. They say its power is so strong that a meteoroid can be broken into pieces with one attack. Well, you must know best about how fierce it is, though."</i><ul><li>If the player selects a Rayquaza already knowing Dragon Ascent:</li></ul><i>"That Rayquaza has already learned Dragon Ascent."</i><ul><li>If the player does not have a Rayquaza in the party:</li></ul><i>"Hmm...
