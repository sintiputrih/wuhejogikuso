He comes from a mixed heritage, with Dominican and African-American roots. Fabolous grew up in the Breevort Houses located in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. During his senior year of high school, he started rapping under the name Fabolous Sport, which was a reference to the Polo Sport line by the fashion brand Ralph Lauren. Eventually, he shortened his stage name to just Fabolous. Interestingly, the misspelling of the word “Fabulous” as “Fabolous” was accidental. While freestyling, he mistakenly spelled it that way, and the unconventional spelling ended up sticking with him.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Related_searches></span>Related searches<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fabolous Net worth 2023/2024/2025/2026, Fabolous Net worth Forbes</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZppq7trHGoWWcp51kv6bCyJ6urGeWlq%2BwuM6uqmamlal6uLvRrZ9mamBngG5%2Bj2trZmpgZ4Jufo9rbWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
