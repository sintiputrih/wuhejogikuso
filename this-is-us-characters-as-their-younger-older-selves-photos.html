The Pearson family has morphed from kids to adults before fans’ eyes throughout the course of&nbsp;<a href=#>This Is Us</a>.</p><p>The NBC drama introduced viewers to Jack Pearson (<a href=#><strong>Milo Ventimiglia</strong></a>), Rebecca Pearson (<a href=#><strong>Mandy Moore</strong></a>), Kevin Pearson (<a href=#><strong>Justin Hartley</strong></a>), Kate Pearson (<a href=#><strong>Chrissy Metz</strong></a>), Randall Pearson (<a href=#><strong>Sterling K. Brown</strong></a>), Beth Pearson (<a href=#><strong>Susan Kelechi Watson</strong></a>) and Toby Damon (<a href=#><strong>Chris Sullivan</strong></a>) as grown-ups upon its debut in September 2016.</p><p>Since then, the show welcomed baby, kid, teen, middle-aged and elderly versions of the beloved brood. Whether portrayed by the same actor (shout-out to Moore for <a href=#>slaying as Rebecca at any age</a>) or a variety of performers, each iteration gives fans a new vantage point to understand the characters and their complicated family dynamic.</p><p>Viewers met the Big Three as babies and adults in the series premiere. They had to wait longer for others. Rebecca first appeared as a young girl in season 1, while Jack debuted as a young boy in season 2. Beth and Toby received the bottle episode treatment with hours in season 3 dedicated to their upbringings, giving fans a glimpse at their characters as children and teenagers.</p><p>Of course, some are destined to remain forever young. Jack died in the ‘90s, which, to this day, <a href=#>instills worry about his future with the show</a>. Ventimiglia shot down the chatter in a May 2019 interview with&nbsp;Us Weekly. “It’s so funny! Why do people say that?” he pondered at the time. “We have three more seasons of Jack!”</p><p>He continued: “[Creator] <strong>Dan [Fogelman]</strong> told me in the beginning, ‘Even though you’re dead in the first episode … you’re not going anywhere. You’re gonna be there the whole time.’ I’m like, ‘I get it.’ I make the bad correlation like [<a href=#>Game of Thrones</a>’] Ned Stark. It’s not, like, he gets his head chopped off and he’s gone. You don’t see <a href=#><strong>Sean Bean</strong></a> anymore. No, no, no, Jack’s still around.”</p><p>Fogelman, for his part, revealed in May 2018 that <a href=#>he “already shot pieces of the final scene of the series.”</a> Given his trajectory, fans should expect if other iterations of the core cast are supposed to show up, it’s been mapped out.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We’re pretty far out,” the producer told reporters at a For Your Consideration event. “We know where it ends and we know the path for each season. We’ve always had a plan, we didn’t want to get stuck. … The show won’t overstay its welcome, we have a story to tell, we want to do this the right way.”</p><p>Scroll to see photos of&nbsp;This Is Us&nbsp;characters as their younger and older selves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bptaq%2FjKKqZq2jYrCprdGamq2doqh6or%2BMrZ%2BeoaJixrDBzaCcq2WfobGmvoysnKWulah6sbTOraasZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
