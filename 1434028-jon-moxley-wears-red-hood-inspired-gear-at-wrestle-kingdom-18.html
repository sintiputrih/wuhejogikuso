This story served as the first origin story for The Joker. In recent years, Red Hood was the persona taken on by Jason Todd, also known as the second Robin. Todd was killed off by the Joker in Batman: Death in the Family, but came back to life and used the Hood persona.</p><p>Last month, Moxley told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bleacher Report</a>‘s Chris Mueller that Red Hood was a personal favorite of his. Moxley said he watched Titans, which featured Curran Walters as Jason Todd/Red Hood, and gave his critique of the show.</p><p>“I just watched that show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Titans</a>,” Moxley said. “It started out ok. I read some of the books so I was familiar with the characters. I liked that it was violent even though Robin, when you put him in a real-life live-action scenario wearing the stupid f–king little mask, like, how do we know that’s not you? It’s so dumb. Just putting a little thing over your eyes is not hiding your identity. And the yellow and all that s–t. It’s hard to look cool and badass in a live-action scenario in a Robin outfit.</p><p>“It got pretty good in season 2 and then the third season just went all to hell with all this voodoo and supernatural powers. It started to lose me and then it was over. I’m a big Batman fan and that whole world, and I’m a big Red Hood fan. He’s probably my favorite comic book character. The kid that played him in the show was a little too young. The helmet was bigger than him.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsa2lqaGK3sLqMpqaxpJWuerixwKuqZqqVmXqpu86dZKKmo6W2s7HDZp6emaJirrV51qucrKycmnqstc2gm6ilXWaF</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
