This is your first trip to a planet as the Pathfinder. This is where the world opens up and the game becomes bigger (and more like a Mass Effect game). And, like everything else you’ve done in the game already, it spawns several distracting side missions.</p><p id=CmPYE1>A lot of these steps are actually quite straightforward, but they’re going to introduce you to a few new concepts and mechanics.
