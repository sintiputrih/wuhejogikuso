With this new movie come some major changes in story, production and in casting that fans are slowly adjusting to. Will the fourth installment find the same success as the previous films? To sum it up, here's everything we know about Hotel Transylvania 4.</p><p><strong>Updated on February 8, 2022: </strong>When this article was originally published, Hotel Transylvania: Transformania was set for a theatrical release in October 2021. However, plans changed and its release was pushed back, and ultimately the film was released as an Amazon Prime Video streaming exclusive in January 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film received mediocre reviews from critics and it currently has a 52% score on Rotten Tomatoes. Some reviewers felt that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the film was missing something without the voice of Adam Sandler</a>, even though Brian Hull does a good job filling in for him as Drac. That being said, Hotel Transylvania: Transformania still had plenty of star power, with the likes of Andy Samberg and Selena Gomez in two of the main roles. Adam Sandler and Kevin James have still yet to give an explanation as to why they did not return for the fourth and final instalment in the franchise.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-story-of-39-hotel-transylvania-4-39><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>What Is The Story Of 'Hotel Transylvania 4'?</span></h2><p>As Dracula and co head back at the Hotel, Abraham Van Helsing introduces the "Monsterification Ray," a device that turns any human into a monster and vice versa.

Many animated productions, such as Tom & Jerry, SpongeBob's upcoming Patrick Star spin-off, Sing 2, and even Hotel Transylvania 4 have been at least partially produced remotely from home.</p><h2 id=selena-gomez-served-as-an-executive-producer><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Selena Gomez Served As An Executive Producer</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to voicing Drac's daughter Mavis, singer <strong>Selena Gomez </strong>will also serve as an executive producer of the film.
