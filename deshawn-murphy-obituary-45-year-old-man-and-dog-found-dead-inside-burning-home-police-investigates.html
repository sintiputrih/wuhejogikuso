The Jefferson County Coroner’s Office officially identified the victim after Birmingham Fire and Rescue Service, along with the police, responded to a blaze at 4328 Willard Avenue S.W. around 12:15 p.m. on Monday.</p><p>Upon entering the house, firefighters discovered Murphy and a dog unresponsive just inside the front door. Both had suffered gunshot wounds and were declared dead at the scene at 1:23 p.m. The situation escalated when an unknown assailant fired shots at a friend of the victim, who was sitting in a vehicle outside the house. The friend sustained a gunshot wound to the side and fled on foot.</p><p>The sequence of events regarding Murphy’s fatal shooting in relation to the friend’s injuries remains unclear. The chaos unfolded further as shortly after the shooting, a fire was reported at the residence. It is yet to be determined whether Murphy was fatally shot before or after the friend was targeted. As of now, no arrests have been made in connection with this incident.</p><p>This grim event marks the 122nd homicide in Birmingham this year alone. The broader scope reveals that in Jefferson County, there have been a total of 168 homicides, encompassing the 122 in Birmingham. Notably, one of these cases involved an officer-involved shooting by an external law enforcement agency, while eight others have been deemed justifiable. The community is left grappling with the aftermath of this violent act, and the authorities are diligently working to unravel the circumstances surrounding Deshawn Kahill Murphy’s untimely demise.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwsMSsn5qvnmK6tr7PobBmp5Kewbat0bJkbW1drrKivoyoo51lnZa7bq3NnWSdp5dis7DBzZ1knZ2RmXqqutKim55lkqq%2Fr7XNoGShp52aerG7y6KanmWZo8Omv9Oinpqslah8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
