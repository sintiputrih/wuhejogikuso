The ceremony was officiated by <a href=#>Grace & Frankie star, Lily Tomlin</a>.</p><p>In a clip tweeted by Griffin, Tomlin was filmed saying: "What was supposed to be a shallow, 'toot it and boot it' one-night stand has grown and flourished into something far more meaningful. They stayed together. Then they couldn't stay away from one another."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At that time, the bride also tweeted that her wedding dress was the same outfit she wore on their first date. "I asked Randy to pick out which ever one of my long dresses was his favorite for any reason," she wrote. "He picked out this dress and showed me this photo [of their first date]. Romance is hotttt again."</p><p>Bick has been with Griffin throughout <a href=#>her lung cancer battle</a> which she announced to her fans via Instagram in August 2021. "I've got to tell you guys something. I have cancer," she said back then. "I'm about to go into surgery to have half of my left lung removed. Yes, I have lung cancer even though I've never smoked!"</p><p>In December 2021, she said in an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live that she was "officially cancer-free." She also explained that she sounded different due to her operation. "So now I'm like Minnie Mouse meets Marilyn Monroe," Griffin said of her new voice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>ASAP Rocky Disses Travis Scott At Performance For How He Treated Rihanna During Past Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=is-a-ap-rocky-planning-to-marry-rihanna>Is A$AP Rocky Planning To Marry Rihanna?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/rihanna-and-asap-rocky-attending-the-2021-met-gala.jpg><p>There have been rumors about Rocky and Rihanna being engaged or even secretly married.
