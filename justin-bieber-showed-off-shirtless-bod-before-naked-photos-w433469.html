He wore green and blue swim shorts and wrapped a light blue towel around his shoulders.</p><p>Some of his tattoos were visible thanks to the minimal clothing. Bieber, who has more than 50 tats, showed off the massive cross in the middle of his chest, "1975" in roman numerals (it's the year his mom, Pattie Mallette, was born), a crown on his right collarbone and the word "Purpose" above his bellybutton.</p><p>All of Bieber's tattoos were exposed the following day, though. On August 4, <a href=#>photos were taken of Bieber swimming </a>completely naked with <a href=#>Australian model <b>Sahara Ray</b></a> and a couple of her friends. The pics were published by the New York<i> Daily News</i>, just days after<b> </b><a href=#><b>Orlando Bloom</b> ditched his clothes</a> while<a href=#> paddleboarding with girlfriend <b>Katy Perry</b></a> in Italy.</p><p><a href=#>Bieber's dad, <b>Jeremy</b>, joked</a> about his son's revealing outing via Twitter. â€œMy boy," the 41-year-old wrote on August 6, in a since-deleted tweet.</p><span class=caption></span><p>Nude photos of the musician previously made the rounds in October 2015. He threatened to sue the same publication for posting the pics, and opened up about the situation weeks later.</p><p>"[My manager] <b>Scooter</b> [<b>Braun</b>] hit me up and was like, 'Yo, I hate to tell you this, but your penis is on the internet,'" he told <b>Ellen DeGeneres</b> that November. "It wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGajraOptq95waKcm52iYsCpu9aem2anlpt6tLTIq6ulnaOoeqO7w2aZnp6fp7JuusCknJ1loJ28tbvSZq5ta2Npg3p7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
