She is only very private about her family life through social media with a very limited appearance.</p>Joe Cohn, her partner, was a clerk, retired at forty-five, and a couple of years ago had bragged that he’d been with twenty-three separate people. Rhea Cohn was an E-3, her husband a staff sergeant, and, like her husband, she was on maternity leave with her first infant. When a kid was born, they called him Clark Hughes Cohn. Prior to her marriage to Joe Chandler, Rhea was previously married to Chuck Planka for a few years.<span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span> <span><p><span>Early Life & Education :</span></p><p><span>At present, Rhea understands that she intends to go into the radio business as a career. She has revealed it to her family from an early age, and her mother has made this a key topic of discussion since. Sports is at least one of Rhea’s oldest hobbies in addition to music, as it is a common hobby among her siblings and other family members.</span><span><br></span><span>She is chasing a dream of her own while also remaining true to home base. She accomplished this by entering Temple University, in Pennsylvania, and graduating with a degree in radio, video, and television.</span></p></span><span><span><span><br></span></span><p><span>Job, Salary & Net Worth :</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span>Rhea has been in the company for a time, working at radio as a traffic announcer and producer.</span><span><br></span><span>Over the next few years, she worked as a sports update anchor; a producer and engineer for the 76ers broadcast; and an Eagles reporter for the station.</span><span><br></span><span>For four years from 2011-2015, she also hosted CSNPhilly.com’s Lunch Break webcast.</span><br><span><br></span><span>In 1997, Rhea entered the WIP Morning Show alongside Angelo Cataldi and Al Morganti — a role that she still retains to this day. Although some criticize her for her outspoken views, she also has many fans who respect her knowledge and opinion of Philly sports.</span><br><span><br></span><span>During her time with WIP, Rhea has devoted some of her time to ventures outside of the station. She has worked as a sideline reporter for the Philadelphia Soul arena football team and as the P.A. as the announcer for Temple University’s women’s basketball program.</span><br><span><br></span><span>In 2006, Hughes filled in as a commentator for her alma mater’s football team broadcast.</span></p></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span> <span><span><span><br></span></span><p><span>Fun Facts, Height & Trivia :</span></p><ul><li aria-level=1><p role=presentation><span>Iverson was one of the players who publicly mocked Allen at times when he was with the Sixers.
