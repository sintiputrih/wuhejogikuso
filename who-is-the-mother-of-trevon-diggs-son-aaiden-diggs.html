Darez Diggs played for Friendship Collegiate<br>Academy Public Charter School in Washington, DC whereas Stefon Diggs played for Our<br>Lady of Good Counsel in Olney, Maryland. At present, Stefon plays for the Buffalo Bills as a<br>wide receiver.</p><h3>Who Is The Mother Of Trevon Diggs’ Son Aaiden Diggs?</h3><p>We are not sure if the 23-year-old-football cornerback, Trevon Diggs is married or not. He<br>hasn’t really disclosed anything about his family, or his wife.</p><p>Trevon Diggs has a son named, Aaiden Diggs. Sadly, we are clueless about who his<br>baby mama is. Reportedly, he dated Chinese Kitty, who is a musical artist, in the past.<br>However, their relationship didn’t work out well and they broke up.</p><p>The Dallas cornerback is supported by hundreds of fans across the country, but arguably the most special is his 4-year old son, Aaiden.</p><p>Aaiden’s uplifting cheers work wonders on Diggs’ athletic performance. This is by no means the first time the Aaiden has been caught lending support to the Dallas Cowboys star. He has in the past requested that his father end games with a touchdown and interception.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ytn55lnaTBqbHRZqafZaSnsre7zWabop%2BXqHq0u81mmJqhlJq7brDIoJ6sZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
