With the rest of the money, you pay as much as you can on the smallest debt. You do this until all your debts are paid, with the exception of your house.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong> – ”Save 3-6 months worth of expenses in an emergency fund” – following this will protect you and your family in case you lose your job.</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong> – ”Invest 15% of income into retirement.”</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong> – ”Save for child’s college fund” – following this step is especially good for your children as they will be debt-free when they finish college; however, some people disagree with this since they don’t feel obligated to pay for their children’s college degree.</p><p><strong>Step 6</strong> – ”Pay off your mortgage early.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 7</strong> – ”Build wealth and give generously.”</p><p>The price for the Financial Peace University course is $129.99/year.</p><p>Therefore, American author Rachel Cruze has an estimated net worth of $2 million.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: </strong><a href=#>Who is Doublelift girlfriend?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfp66ktMSlZJyqpa%2BycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
