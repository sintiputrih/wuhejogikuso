Like what songs we want to dance to. Just some final details, but yeah, almost ready!”</p><p>Despite the fact that her fellow figure skater, 37, <a href=#>proposed in July 2017</a>, Davis feels the pressure of a dwindling timeline. “We’ve been engaged for a while, and it felt like we had a lifetime to prepare,” she explained. “Now that we’re only a couple of months out, it’s like, ‘Oh, wow. This is happening really soon!’”</p><p>The ice dancer added that the pair will tie the knot in the south of France this summer, followed by a weeklong honeymoon in Europe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Meryl-Davis-Fedor-Andreev-Wedding-Planning-02.jpg><p>Davis’ longtime figure skating partner, <a href=#><strong>Charlie White</strong></a>, will be by her side too when she walks down the aisle. “I’m already married, so she’s late to the party!” the 31-year-old athlete quipped to&nbsp;Us. “It’s odd. I mean, first of all, how awesome that I get to go to the south of France — just celebrate her and her fiancé. So I’m just happy for her.” (He married <strong>Tanith Belbin</strong> in April 2015.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>White went on to <a href=#>describe his bond</a> with the <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> <a href=#>season 18 winner</a>. “I’ve known her and I spend more time with her probably than almost anyone else, including her parents, maybe!” he noted. “So just to see her in her best moment or moment of happiness. A lot of work for her has gone into getting it just right. And so I’ll be happy to just be on the celebratory end and enjoying it.”</p><p>Don’t expect the gold medalists to team up for a performance at the wedding, though. “No! I don’t want any spotlight,” White insisted. “I will not be taking any of it. No, no, this is about her and her fiancé!”</p><p>With reporting by Lexi Ciccone</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamnaKuuW6wwK%2BgrGWZqHqiuMyoqq1llKS7pnnPpZinppmjtG7DxJ2boqaXYsGwecWem6iqXZa7pb7Enq1o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
