Each show's season often opens with an event hosted by one of its stars, there are always one or two cast trips involved, and the season ends with a reunion that can range from one to four additional episodes.</p><p>For many Housewives fans, the reunions are must-see TV. It’s where the cast addresses all of the beef, fun and <a href=#>dangerous shade</a>, and has tearful moments.</p><p>Since its launch in 2009, <a href=#>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</a> has had explosive reunions (<a href=#>Caroline Manzo</a> and <a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a>’s shade will forever be iconic). However, the cast’s <a href=#>13th and 14th seasons</a> might have been too much for its network to endure.</p><p>In June 2024, reports surfaced that, for the first time in its history, RHONJ wouldn’t have a traditional reunion. Unfortunately, viewers of the show aren’t that surprised it has come to this.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">‘The Real Housewives of New Jersey’ won’t have a Season 14 reunion, and there is reportedly “no path forward” for the cast.</h2><p>The Real Housewives of New Jersey cast has developed a reputation for tussling since Season 1 with Teresa Giudice’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">now legendary table flip</a>. But Seasons 13 and 14 were so brutal that Bravo canceled a sit-down RHONJ reunion to wrap up Season 14.</p><p>Throughout both seasons, <a href=#>Teresa and Melissa Gorga</a>’s ongoing feud caused a clear divide among their fellow cast members, Jennifer Aydin, <a href=#>Danielle Cabral</a>, <a href=#>Margaret Josephs</a>, Rachel Fuda, and friends of RHONJ, Jackie Goldschneider and Jennifer Fessler.</p><p>Following their fallout over Tre’s <a href=#>August 2022 wedding</a> and <a href=#>allegations made against one another</a>, she and Melissa refused to film any scenes together during the season. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> confirmed the sisters-in-law finally spoke at the Season 14 finale, which was teased at the end of the season premiere.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>The explosive event reportedly caused Bravo to shut down a traditional reunion that would have forced Teresa, Melissa, and the rest of the divided cast into the same room. According to a source reportedly close to the series, the finale will show how irretrievably broken the cast has become.</p><p>“A reunion is meant to have a resolution, and it's clear in the season final that there is no path forward in that type of setting," the source told People in June 2024.

For Housewives, specifically, it’s never a good sign when there’s not even a one-part special to wrap up the season.</p><p>The changes to the reunion have led fans to believe Season 14 could be the last of RHONJ as we know it.</p><p>In May 2024, <a href=#>Andy Cohen told Distractify</a> that RHONJ could be the next show in the Bravoverse to receive a cast shakeup. Andy said the cast is on “two very clear teams.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>In addition to Teresa and Melissa’s anchor feud, Tre’s beef with Margaret has also kept the drama going amongst the friend group. Season 14 also included Jennifer Fessler and Rachel’s short-lived drama and <a href=#>Danielle Cabral and Jennifer Aydin’s feud</a>, which reportedly escalated at the Season 14 finale.</p><p>As Teresa and Melissa remain at odds, reports have surfaced that Bravo would ultimately have to fire one of them (or both) to bring the show the peace it needs.</p><p>The Real Housewives of New Jersey airs on Bravo on Sundays at 8 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2asmJp6s7TOp6Fmq5WWwLC6jGprZqqVqruqu81mnp6sXZiur6%2FEpZyd</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
