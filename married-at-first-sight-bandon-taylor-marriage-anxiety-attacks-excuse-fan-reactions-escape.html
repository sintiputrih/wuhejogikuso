At the moment, it looks unrepairable. Even though experts on 'Married At First Sight' have tried to get the two on the same page, they have inherent issues that will take time to iron out.&nbsp;</p><p>On the second day of their honeymoon, Brandon gave Taylor the silent treatment for making a funny tape of him snoring. He thought it was disrespectful but refused to bring it up until they were with the other couples by the pool.</p><p>Brandon is a private person and cameras can prove to be bothersome for someone who is not a very open person.

"Brandon has the emotional maturity of a squash," a user posted.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Taylor's behavior hasn't been top-notch as well. She had shared a video on Instagram talking about the qualities she'd like in a man adding that she would probably be single all her life. This put Brandon off and he left their house in order to process what had happened. He expected an apology, which Taylor refused to offer.&nbsp;</p><p>Catch all the new episodes of 'Married At First Sight' on Lifetime every Wednesday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopZGnv6qxw2aYrWWWnr%2B0wIysoKCgpGKvorrDqKVmrJGuubC%2BjKaYq6qZlrSmecCnr6KdpK56osDTmpqkq12axaTB0p5kn5meYr%2BmrcKtoKimo2KytK%2FAqZw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
