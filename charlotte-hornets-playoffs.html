It has turned same for the <strong>Charlotte Hornets</strong>. The franchise signed LaMelo Ball as their #3 overall pick. Not only that, but they changed their roster completely. They added Gordon Hayward, Terry Rozier to their squad. After a rough start, the team had a great winning run. But they were out casted by some great games against the giants of East. However, they are back to winning run after a thrilling win over the Sacramento Kings earlier today.</p><p>Charlotte Hornets went head to head against the Sacramento Kings. It was a battle of the prodigies. DeAaron Fox was once called the prodigy when he joined professional basketball. Arguably the fastest player in the NBA, Fox had a tough on the court. However, LaMelo Ball did not fail to impress. He closed out neck to neck game with 24 points. PJ Washington was the highlight hero in today’s game. He added 42-points to his name. He was unstoppable. Regardless, Sac covered the deficit. It took Malik Monk’s heroic effort to register the win. Monk drove to the basket with less than 5 seconds on the game clock. Not only did he draw the foul but counted making it an and one situation. Later he converted the free throw and Hornets were up ahead by 1 to seal the deal.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Tough Road ahead for Charlotte Hornets</strong>; But will they be able to break their Playoff Jinx?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The Charlotte Hornets are currently 8th in the Eastern Conference. But despite hard earned efforts, they lack consistency. The franchise has an excellent offensive attack. LaMelo Ball is making excellent plays. Terry Rozier and Gordon Hayward are in their primes. Miles Bridges is breaking rims with his explosive plays. Yet the team is crippling on defence. In today’s game, they contained DeAaron Fox. This was a great defensive remark that even the analysts acknowledged. It is not a straight road for the Hornets now on.</p><p>The team game has proved to be strong for the Hornets. They have a decent chemistry that has eloped them to play a better game. But a defensive communication needs work. Their probability to make it to the playoffs is very high if they continue the same performance. Regardless of a tough journey, they have pleased everyone with their game. Although the team is just inching into playoff spot, but it is still a tussle between the teams ranked lower in the Eastern Conference.</p><p>Also Read: <strong><a href=#>Miami Heat beats Atlanta Hawks to register 6th straight victory</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57wqGYq6SfqcGmeceoqaedpKh6sbjAsqafnqNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
