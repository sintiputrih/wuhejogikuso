Known for her diverse roles in films such as 'Mean Girls', 'Les Misérables', and 'Mamma Mia!', Seyfried shared her experiences of feeling like she was taken advantage of and reflected on decisions she took that she wishes she could change.</p><p>Ahead of the highly anticipated release of 'The Crowded Room', a period psychological thriller on Apple TV+, Seyfried sat down with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Newsweek</a> to discuss her latest project alongside co-star Tom Holland. However, the conversation soon turned to the topic of regrets and professional challenges.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/6e9f98e9-6fdd-44be-af5c-c23a6f65a392.jpg><h2 class=split>'Still in the process of trying to find my own voice'</h2><p>Seyfried acknowledged that her regrets did not stem from the choices she made in her work but rather how she navigated the industry. "I think the regrets weren't the choices I made in work. I think the regrets are choices made and how I dealt with things at work," said Seyfried. "And I am still in the process of trying to find my own voice, and stick to it, and hold my ground." She continued, "I think I was taken advantage of, and I have regrets in letting people stay in my professional life longer than they should have." These experiences have prompted Seyfried to reassess her approach to the industry and advocate for herself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/95052c5d-12f1-419f-a3c5-71f41b823d84.jpg><p>While Seyfried previously expressed regret about her role in 'Les Misérables', particularly due to the challenges of live singing, she clarified that her other regrets were more related to industry decisions rather than her performances. She spoke of enduring difficult personalities and individuals who did not have her best interests at heart, acknowledging that such experiences were not limited to the entertainment industry but had a greater impact in that context.</p><h2 class=split>Gratitude and Selective Choices</h2><p>Reflecting on her career journey, Seyfried expressed gratitude for the opportunities she has had, recognizing that everything falls into place as it is meant to. However, she did humorously express a wish to have been "naked less" on screen, suggesting a desire for more selective choices in that regard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/7f75017f-1b66-48cb-bb9e-6445832c0985.jpg><p>"I suffered through strange personalities, and personalities who didn't have my best interests at heart. And that's life stuff, but when it's in your career world, it makes things even worse, in a way? Because you're tied to them in a business sense," she told the outlet, adding, "It was just more choices I made, relationships I stayed in too long. I don't have any regrets about movies I did because I, I don't know, I think everything falls into place the way it's meant to, and I'm so grateful for the opportunities I have had. I just wish I'd been naked less, I guess too" she said looking off into the distance."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/5c0ddf74-caf8-4bb2-bc62-dfb485ebd4c3.jpg><p>In 'The Crowded Room', Seyfried takes on the role of Rya Goodwin, who finds herself interrogating Tom Holland's troubled character, Danny Sullivan. The highly anticipated drama, based on the 1981 non-fiction novel 'The Minds of Billy Milligan', also features Emmy Rossum, Will Chase, Sasha Lane, and Seyfried's real-life husband, Thomas Sadoski.</p><p><strong>'The Crowded Room' will be available to stream on AppleTV+ on June 9.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRorJiaeqS%2BzrCbnpxdp7ywuYysq5qqXZa6orrDmmSsnambv6qxw2apnp%2BimsG0ecGeoKefXaOurLHDZquop12ks7WxzWamp2WjmL%2Bmsc1mmJ2lmanAbsDOZpmeoZ6cerWtyp6lZpmUq66vwMCgnGanlmKyor7LsmSopg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
