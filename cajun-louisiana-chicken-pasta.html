Have you ever played bunco? Itâ€™s basically a game of zero strategy and all luck. &nbsp;It consists of mindlessly rolling the dice so you can focus on talking with your friends. It was an excuse to get together, laugh, and eat really good food.</p><p>Every month we were assigned to bring a main dish, appetizer, salad, or dessert. It was our chance to try out a fun, new recipe! I randomly decided that I was going to make Jambalaya.</p><p>&nbsp;I had never made such a unique dish in my life but I thought why not experiment with my unsuspecting friends! Cajun food is known for its intense flavors and spice so it HAD to be good.</p><p>I will never forget showing up with an enormous dish of it and not a single person even knew what in the world it was. They had never heard of it! I tried to reassure them that it tasted amazing and was super flavorful, but needless to say I went home with A LOT of jambalaya. Most of the women were afraid to try it!</p><p>I am pretty sure my husband and I ate jambalaya leftovers for a straight week. Next time, I made creamy chicken enchiladas and all of the AZ girls knew those very well. Haha!</p><p>Years ago, we ate at Cheesecake Factory and tried their Louisiana Pasta and LOVED the combinations of peppers, onions, and cajun spiced cream that enveloped the pasta.</p><p>I wanted to re-create something with similar flavors ever since. So today we are going New Orleans and whipping up a Cajun Louisiana Chicken Pasta.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cajunlouisiannachickenpasta.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ingredients:</h2><ul><li>Butter</li><li>Onion</li><li>Chicken Breast&nbsp;</li><li>Salt and Pepper</li><li>Cajun Seasoning</li><li>Red Pepper</li><li>Orange or Yellow Pepper</li><li>Chicken Broth</li><li>Heavy Cream</li><li>Parmesan Cheese</li><li>Pasta of choice</li><li>Roma Tomatoes(optional)</li><li>Pine Nuts (optional)</li></ul><p>This <strong>Cajun Chicken Pasta</strong> is made by sauteing onions, red peppers, orange peppers, and yellow peppers in butter until softened. &nbsp;Chicken and cajun seasoning is added and cooked until nice and golden. &nbsp;Then it is slowly simmered in chicken broth to bring out the flavor.</p><p>&nbsp;Heavy cream is drizzled in to bring some richness to the dish. &nbsp;It is seasoned with parsley and and parmesan cheese.
