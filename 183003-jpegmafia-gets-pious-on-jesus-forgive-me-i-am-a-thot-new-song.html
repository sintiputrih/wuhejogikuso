I also wish more artists had as much fun on their songs as JPEGMAFIA. The&nbsp;Veteran rapper has never shied away from the absurd - in fact, it's where he prefers to reside. He finds humor in the paradoxical balance between flexing and self-deprecation. Most bars flip back-and-forth between these poles. He'll clown his own outfit before you get the chance to (see single artwork), but threaten to shoot you regardless ("Feel like when I'm shootin, I'm shiftin time / Dressed in your grandmama hand-me-downs"). Even on the song's title, "Jesus Forgive Me, I Am a Thot", it's seen how piecing together things that are so jarringly opposed leads to a product that is undeniably fascinating.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Peggy plays with these tensions sonically, as well. On this track, he dabbles in his usual spastic production, inserting glitchy noises&nbsp;over some beautiful piano chords. The song pulls you in so many directions that you don't know what exactly you're supposed to be feeling, but you know it's an exhilarating experience. His rapping starts off mellow, but halfway through the first verse,&nbsp;he's&nbsp;shouting while the beat self-destructs. The song reverts back to mellow territory for the chorus, where JPEG starts bursting out melodic lines like a damn Backstreet Boy. But he said it himself: "Bitch, I'm a diva".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Pray you get in comfy yourdisguise<br>Pray for mythots on the other side<br>Prayfor my children I can't provide, I feel 45<br>Pray when you shoot, it's a homicide<br>Pray for my haters, they terrified</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhbYBxfJJmoamdl6Kup7XAZp6erKNivaq71KxkqKZdn7K0wdJmnaiql57DpnnMnmSiZZGieqJ506GmrWWemsRuv86nng%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
