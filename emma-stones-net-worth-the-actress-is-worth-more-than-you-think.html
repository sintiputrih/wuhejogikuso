Stone started her acting career in television, according to her <a href=#>IMDb page</a>, landing small roles in shows such as&nbsp;Medium,&nbsp;The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, and&nbsp;Malcolm in the Middle. By 2007, however, Stone made her way into the film industry, landing a starring role in the comedy&nbsp;<a href=#>Superbad</a>. In 2009, she starred in another hit film,&nbsp;Zombieland, which helped put the actress on the comedy scene.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, Stone's career really took off once she landed the lead role as Olive in&nbsp;Easy A. The film was met with both commercial and critical success, and from there, Stone continued to land hot roles. From&nbsp;Crazy, Stupid, Love to&nbsp;The Amazing Spider-Man&nbsp;to&nbsp;The Help, Stone spent much of the early 2010s starring in some of the biggest movies to hit the big screen. In 2017, the actress won her first <a href=#>Oscar</a> for her performance in&nbsp;La La Land, which she starred in alongside Ryan Gosling.&nbsp;</p><p>With her latest movie&nbsp;Cruella&nbsp;set to hit theaters in May 2021 (via <a href=#>Forbes</a>), Stone is certainly not slowing down anytime soon, so we can only expect to see her already impressive net worth continue to grow.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGxhaYNxe8SmpJplo6m8r7HSZqWerF2svLPAx2aroZ1dlrC1vsSsqmaho2LEsL7ToWSmp6KaerW0wKdksqelYsGptc2kZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
