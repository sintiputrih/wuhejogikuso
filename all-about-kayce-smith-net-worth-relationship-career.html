Truthfully, a woman’s fortitude and ability to persevere determine who she is just as much as her physical attractiveness. Kayce Smith is one such woman who has achieved not just fame as a sportscaster but also the status of survivor thanks to her incredible fight against melanoma cancer.</strong></p><p>The stress of everyday life is bad enough, but when cancer is thrown into the mix, it can feel unbearable. In contrast, Smith was never the type to give up in the face of adversity. She showed incredible strength of character and determination to overcome incredible odds during her medical treatment.</p><p>The American returned to her regular broadcasting duties, becoming a role model and motivation to young men and women going through similar situations.</p><p>Today, we explore Kayce Smith’s background and career as a host in further detail. We will also talk about her early life, schooling, professional life, wealth, and marital status.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Kayce_Smith_Salary_Earnings><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"What is the Net Worth of ABC? Salary, Earnings"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4480,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial"}'>What is the Net Worth of Kayce Smith? Salary, Earnings</span></span></h2><p>For instance, after working as a reporter, host, and sportscaster for ten years, Kayce amassed an astounding $2 million in wealth. Her exact compensation is a mystery, but it’s likely well into the five figures.</p><p>The average annual salary of a sportscaster is said to be between <strong>$50,000 and $55,000</strong> per various web resources. In a similar vein, salaries can go up to $84k if one is in a high-level position.</p><p>At the same time, we think that the gender pay gap exists not only in the broadcasting industry but in others as well. Hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, women with skills like Kayce’s will be compensated more fairly.</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Kayce_Smith_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Where was ABC born?

Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></span></h2><p>On October 25, 1988 (USA), Kayce Smith was born in Texas. In addition, her proud father, Ron Smith, and an unknown woman gave birth to her. Ally Elaine Smith has an elder sister named Kayce.</p><p>She is also a native-born American citizen of the Caucasian race.<br>Furthermore, Smith is a Scorpio, as indicated by horoscopes. The horoscope predicts that the sportscaster will be secretive, driven, and determined.</p><p>Because Scorpios are notoriously private, many details of her formative years remain shrouded in mystery. However, Kayce did go to college, graduating from Texas A&M University with a BA in Communication.</p><p>The Texan’s enthusiasm for athletics and her desire to become a journalist often came into conflict. It now seems natural for someone to be both a sports fan and a broadcaster.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style="width:80%;margin:0 auto" class=mytable width=100%><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Kayce Smith</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Date</strong></td><td>October 25, 1988</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nick Name</strong></td><td>Kayce</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Religion</strong></td><td>Undefined</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td>Caucasian</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Education</strong></td><td>Texas A&M University</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Horoscope</strong></td><td>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td>Ron Smith</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td>Yes (Ally Elaine Smith)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>33 years old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>5’9″ (1.77 m)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>Unavailable</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Shoe Size</strong></td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Blonde</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Grey</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Body Measurement</strong></td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Figure</strong></td><td>Curvy</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Married</strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Boyfriend</strong></td><td>Nathan Sebesta</td></tr><tr><td><b>Children</b></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Sports Broadcaster and Host</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$2 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Salary</strong></td><td>$50,000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Currently Works At</strong></td><td>Barstool Sports</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Affiliations</strong></td><td>NBC, ESPN</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Active Since</strong></td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Social Media</strong></td><td>Instagram,&nbsp;Twitter</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Last Update</strong></td><td>2021</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Kayce_Smith_Weight_Hair_Color><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"How tall is ABC?
