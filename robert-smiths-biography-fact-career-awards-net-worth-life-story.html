Born Robert James Smith in April 21, 1959 in Blackpool, Lancashire, England, Smith comes from a musical family. His father sang while his mother played the piano. He and his sister took piano lessons but he also learned guitar due to sibling rivalry.</p><p>At the age of 13, Smith was already involved in several bands. He was a member of <i>The Crawley Boat</i> band along with his brother, sister and friends. Prior to this, he formed <i>The Obelisk,</i> which later became <i>The Cure</i>. The band had several names and line ups that played at school functions. <i>The Cure</i> was formed in the late seventies as <i>The Easy </i>Cure, comprising along with Robert, Michael Dempsey, Lol Tolhurst and Porl Thompson.</p><p>Smith never intended to be the lead singer, but took the position when the original vocalist left the group. He is also the guitarist and sometimes songwriter for the band. These include&nbsp;<i>The Love Cats,</i> which was the band’s first top ten hit, <i>Let’s Go To Bed,</i> and <i>The Walk</i>.</p><p>Smith is the only band member to have been with the group since its founding. His trademark is smeared red lipstick, black eye liner, and unkempt hair. He also plays the guitar for rock bands <i>Siouxise</i> and the <i>Banshees</i>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqfl7KzwIyspKKsmKh6o7XOoKmaqJiueqetwq1knJmimrKzecCwmKuco2K7psCMsKarrJhiuaqyxGaqraeirnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
