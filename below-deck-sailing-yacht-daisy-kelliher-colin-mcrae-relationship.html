Daisy Kelliher and Colin MacRae's smooch was one of the more shocking ones, and Gary King was not too happy about it. "I definitely never thought I'd be the kind of woman that, you know, I'd be in a love triangle with two guys, let alone it happen this season, but there you go," the chief stew told <a href=#>ET</a>. On King accusing Kelliher of kissing MacRae out of revenge, she shared, "He had two seasons to try and pursue me, he chose not to ... But me and Gary were never anything, you know? I'm not quite sure what he thought that I was trying to gain from that. We were never in a relationship."</p><p dir=ltr>Although Kelliher knew kissing MacRae would cause a stir, she didn't expect such a huge fallout. "I kind of knew it was going to complicate things. I don't think I was quite prepared at the level it complicated things," the chief stew told <a href=#>Parade</a>. "I'm not even sure people knew Colin was single. You know, I already kissed Gary, so maybe it was like, 'Colin's a no-go zone.' It was a lot to take in for everybody," she added. As surprising as the makeout sesh was for the viewers, Kelliher admitted that she always had a thing for MacRae.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampma39zfI6bnKWnp2Kxpq%2FKZqqaoZyeu6h52Jqaoaxdma6qv9hmop6knJ61pr6MnKaloZ5iuqS%2BwJ5kq52clsGqu82sn6KoXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
