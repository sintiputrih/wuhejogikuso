Fans in other countries are beginning to speculate that she and Croatian cellist Stjepan Hauser are dating. However, neither of them has made it clear whether they are a romantic couple or just a charming duo. The captions on some of Hauser’s photos have included such phrases as “Family is rising,” “Autumn, the most romantic season…,” and the like. Following these captions, many of their fans are left wondering if the couple is, in fact, a couple or just friends. Another indication that they may be romantically involved is that they sang duets together while in quarantine. A man by the name of Alberto Urso has previously been linked to Benedetta. Singing was a passion for the alleged couples. The 2018 Amici di Maria De Filippi competition was won by Alberto.
