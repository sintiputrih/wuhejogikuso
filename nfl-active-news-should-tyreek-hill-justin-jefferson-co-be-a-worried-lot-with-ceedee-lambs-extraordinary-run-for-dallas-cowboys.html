Be a Worried Lot With CeeDee LambsExtraordinary Run f</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>The <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Dallas Cowboys</a> were the preseason heartthrobs, and guess what? They’ve strutted their football finesse right into the regular season! Fast forward to Week 10, and these Cowboys are standing tall at 6-3 and just served a 49-17 smackdown to the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>New York Giants</a>. It wasn’t just a win; it was a dominance extravaganza that left everyone’s jaws on the floor. Touchdowns? Oh, they were piling up like Black Friday deals.</p><p>By halftime, the team had already notched up four touchdowns, setting a pace that left opponents dizzy. And hold on, they weren’t just scoring on the field; they were rewriting the record books. League and franchise records were falling like confetti at a championship parade. Second half? Oh, they didn’t ease up. Three more touchdowns, with star receiver CeeDee Lamb pulling off plays that had us all questioning if gravity even applied to him. The Cowboys aren’t just playing football; they’re putting on a show, and we’re all just lucky spectators!</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Cowboys’ secret weapon: CeeDee Lamb, The NFL’s top receiver</strong></h2><p>CeeDee Lamb, the Dallas Cowboys’ pass-rush powerhouse, just pulled off a move straight out of the NFL history books. He made waves by being the first wide receiver ever to snag double-digit catches and rock at least 150 receiving yards in three consecutive games. Oh, and did we mention he threw in two touchdowns for good measure? One with his legs, the other a sweet reception.</p><p>The Cowboys didn’t just beat the Giants; they outpaced them like a cheetah chasing down its lunch. Out gained by a whopping 468 yards, the largest margin in franchise history. Painting a masterpiece with 640 total yards, marking their second-highest in team history. The Cowboys are rewriting their playbook, and CeeDee Lamb is leading the charge. Lamb is not a one-hit-wonder; he’s gunning for the title of the next big thing in wide receivers, giving the likes of <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Tyreek Hill</a> and Justin Jefferson a run for their money. Pro Football Focus even took to ‘X’ to drop Lamb’s stats like it’s hot, captioned “CeeDee Lamb in his last three games“–and it’s nothing short of legendary.</p><p>As the Cowboys ride high, sitting pretty at 2nd in the NFC East, Lamb has become the X-factor. Playoffs? You bet your lucky jersey they’re eyeing that spot, and with Lamb in the mix, who’s gonna doubt them?</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Gridiron maestro: CeeDee Lamb’s symphony of success</strong></h2><p>CeeDee Lamb isn’t just making waves; he’s creating a tsunami of awesomeness in the NFL. After a colossal 49-17 beat down against the Giants, Lamb dropped the mic with, “I’m the top receiver in this game, no doubt about it. If you’re questioning, well, buckle up because I’ll see you next week.” Three straight games with 10+ catches and 150+ receiving yards? Yeah, he just set an NFL record during the Super Bowl era. History, meet CeeDee Lamb, the 24-year-old maestro of the gridiron.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023-10-01T212153Z_880451481_MT1USATODAY21548140_RTRMADP_3_NFL-NEW-ENGLAND-PATRIOTS-AT-DALLAS-COWBOYS.jpg><p>Lamb’s been on a trajectory of pure greatness. In 2022, he clocked in with 107 catches, 1,359 yards, and nine touchdowns, solidifying himself as the Cowboys’ go-to guy. Fast forward to 2023, and Lamb’s not just sipping on success; he’s chugging it down. The Cowboys are sitting pretty at 6-3, and it’s no coincidence that Lamb’s the engine driving this football juggernaut. So, NFL, take note. CeeDee Lamb isn’t just making headlines; he’s writing the playbook for what it means to be the top dog on the field. And if you doubt it, well, see you next week, because Lamb’s just getting started.</p><p><strong>Watch This Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Aaron Rodgers Reveals Bold Goal for Timely Comeback From Injury</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue82fo2aZk6m2t7GMp5ywq12otbDBy51krbGimrKseceio6VlmqrAtbXNZqGenpaav7S7zWaaqGWSmnqiedaoqauhlZl6rbvTZq6irJhisKaxw56cZqSRoq%2B0ecSxq6uZn6exqrrAq7BmqqWjeqe70WabmqSclsBur86wmaixo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
