She was basking in decades-overdue praise for playing Brandy’s stepmother on Moesha, Lauryn Hill’s mom in Sister Act II, and of course Deena Jones, long before Beyoncé ever did, in the original Dreamgirls musical. The entire room was remembering the times she starred alongside Sidney Poitier, Robert De Niro, and Denzel Washington. In that moment, the sheer volume of applause she received drowned out any memories Ralph has of stepping onto a set run by executives who couldn’t identify her or what she’d done. Nonetheless, when she sat down with me at Vulture Festival, she came prepared to teach. Ralph is like a motivational speaker who’s also your favorite auntie and your favorite actress (who can really sing). So when she says she wants to host the next Emmys, we all just hope the Television Academy is listening. Listen to the conversation below or read on for the full transcript.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc0v1w700153b6widx7onx9@published data-word-count=11>A quick heads-up: This conversation includes a reference to disordered eating.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc0523m002e3b6wwbb0rhy9@published data-word-count=69><strong>Sheryl, I’m going to tell you what surprised me the most about your career. Before you got into TV and movies and Broadway, you did a USO tour. Tell the babies here what a USO tour is.</strong><br>Okay. The USO is the United Service Organizations. Celebrities and stars go to foreign U.S. bases around the world, and you perform for the troops. This was at the beginning of my career.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc0aypr003b3b6woygn2p8b@published data-word-count=117><strong>How did you get that gig?</strong><br>Honest to God, this is like a movie script. But back in the day, photographers would put out ads for models and you would go in. Now, most times you are an up-and-coming actor and you need headshots. Usually, you want your headshot to be with your clothes on, but this particular photographer wanted to get you in there to take your clothes off.&nbsp;It always starts with, “Okay, just drop your blouse.” I was like, “No, I really just wanted some headshots shot.” So I left. But I had also answered this audition for a USO tour, and I went to the office, and my God, guess who walks through the door?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc0ayps003c3b6wgd0er3bn@published data-word-count=117><strong>That photographer.</strong><br>The photographer that tried to get me to take my clothes off. And he says to me, “Oh, so you wouldn’t take your clothes off for me, but you’re going to take it off for them?” I was so hurt and embarrassed. I walk in there and I meet this woman, and they’re looking for a singer. I’m like, “I can sing, but I can’t sing with my clothes off.” She slowly raises her golden-blonde head and she said, “We already have the one with her clothes off. We need one who can sing.” I said, “Okay, where?” She said, “You’re a singer — sing.” “Just right here in your office, sing?” And she’s like, “Sing.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc0aypt003d3b6w5l9luu7z@published data-word-count=53><strong>What’d you sing?</strong><br>I don’t know what I sang, but I sang and they hired me. So I went on my first tour of duty.</p><p><strong>Where’d you go?</strong><br>I went to the most beautiful places, but for whatever reason, I remember Turkey.

I would come out in my pin-striped suit and my big hat and I’d say, “Jeremiah was a bullfrog, was a good friend of mine.” The band would come in, and I would do three songs and then say, ” And now for what you are waiting to see. Please, Miss Anneka di Lorenzo.” And she would just float on stage.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc0aypt003f3b6wsiic2bjg@published data-word-count=60><strong>Nude?</strong><br>No. But the outfit made you think it was. It was very diaphanous. It just floated in the air. And she was a wisp of a woman with the most fiery red hair. And she had a smile. This woman would walk out on stage and just float around. That was her talent. Sort of like an early Kim K.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc0aypt003g3b6wc1l5yuph@published data-word-count=10><strong>That’s amazing.</strong><strong><br></strong>It’s the truth.

I bet most of you didn’t know that Sheryl made an album, did you? And it’s really good too.</strong><br>I have a Christmas album coming out. It is aptly titled Sleigh. I took a twist on every one of the songs of the holiday that I loved, and I brought it into the club and I brought it into your home, I brought it into your hip hop experience.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc0aypu003i3b6wkl7lfppu@published data-word-count=51><strong>So you get back from your second USO tour, you’re supposed to stop in LA and then go back to New York.

I had a dream lined up.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc0aypu003j3b6wnpahmq0t@published data-word-count=59><strong>How did you get work?</strong><br>Literally my acting teacher. I went to a great university called Rutgers University. My teacher was now an associate producer with Sidney Poitier, and it was his last film of a trilogy that he had done with Bill Cosby. It was called <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-2 tabindex=0>A Piece of the Action</span> and I was cast. And that was that.</p><span class="quote has-quote-marks">I’m the reverse Frankenstein. It’s been difficult for me in the industry. But I’m happy with my career.

And what would you say when you heard it?</strong><br>You know what? It’s so interesting because I heard it so often.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc0aypu003l3b6waec2r2jb@published data-word-count=71><strong>How does someone deliver that in a way that feels helpful? Do they really think they’re helping in that moment?</strong><br>Believe it or not, what Mr. Poitier was doing for me was telling me a lot of things in a sentence, “You’re an incredible actress and I wish the industry had more to offer you, but if this is for you, you won’t stop.” What more did he have to tell me?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc0aypu003m3b6wcqf29di2@published data-word-count=66><strong>Was De Niro saying the same thing?</strong><br>Robert De Niro said to me, “You are DGA, a damn good actress, but Hollywood is not looking for you. They are not looking for the Black girl. So you better climb that mountain, wave the red flag and let them know you are there because you deserve to be seen.” What more did he need to say to me?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc0aypu003n3b6w47umr9gn@published data-word-count=147><strong>Here’s what I want them to say to you because when I read it, I was like, okay, Sidney’s a big deal, De Niro’s a big deal.

For people to produce anything, it must be a passion because you’re going to spend an awful lot of time with your script, with your passion, with your project. Robert De Niro and I were in a perfect film together where he was one of the producers. So he was doing me a favor in that project. Mr. Poitier was doing me a favor by directing this trilogy that had a classroom full of young Black talent. It was for me to be there to get the right start.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc0aypv003o3b6wwunoar6i@published data-word-count=65><strong>You always have a pleasant and positive and optimistic disposition.

On Broadway. How was that experience?</strong><br>Dreamgirls was a project from <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-3 tabindex=0>Tom Eyen</span>, who we lost way too soon due to AIDS. Tom Eyen had this idea for a girl group. At first, the girl group was set in the ‘40s, ‘50s, and it was a vehicle for Nell Carter. Nell Carter was a great actress back in the day. But she started a series called Gimme a Break and she left the workshop of Project #9, which would become Dreamgirls. Then it became a vehicle for Jennifer Holliday. And it becomes this phenomenal, groundbreaking musical. Sort of like what Hamilton was when it opened. Everybody wanted to see it. Everything goes great for us. But then when they’re doing the movie, they just didn’t want to include us.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc0aypw003s3b6wmcdnz4wt@published data-word-count=14><strong>Really?</strong><strong><br></strong>Yeah.

It’s a lot. And nobody ever talked about that.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc0aypw003u3b6wfsk6nyvc@published data-word-count=145><strong>There were some personal issues for you during the show. You said you </strong><a href=#><strong>weren’t eating</strong></a><strong>.</strong><br>Your brain can do crazy things on you. As Jennifer got larger, literally and figuratively, with all of the wins and everything, I was always the second. I was always the second. You’re hearing it over and over, and then you start to believe it. I’m like, Here I am. I’m coming up second. She’s doing all of this and I can’t sing and I’m blah, blah, blah. Everybody’s telling you what to do. I figured out I will tell myself what to do, so I stopped eating. Because they couldn’t make me eat. One day I opened up the stage door and there my parents were. They dragged me right out of that show and put me into that kind of therapy to help me get it back together again.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc0ayq1003v3b6w5fyhb0c8@published data-word-count=78><strong>Was that the hardest moment?</strong><br>I think that’s one of them. And the fact that Jennifer Holliday was not an actress, per se, so what Michael Bennett came up with was to make her dislike me. Because that would give her the energy to do the character. You tell the brain enough things over and over, it starts to believe it. So we were cheated out of a great relationship.

Exactly. And I was like, “This is so sweet.” And then a year or two later, I get this call, “Miss Ralph, I’ve got this script.” That was what she used to call me, Miss Ralph. Now she just calls me Sheryl. So she said to me, “Miss Ralph, I know that you are at that point in your career where people offer you things and that is exactly what should happen. But if you could just meet the people connected to this project that I’m talking to you about, that would be a very good thing.” And there was something about the way she said it that said, “Just go ahead.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc0ayq200433b6wwfw9jdtn@published data-word-count=15><strong>Did you like the role at first?</strong><strong><br></strong>At first, I really wanted to play Principal Ava.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc0ayq200443b6wohdrfs5m@published data-word-count=60><strong>Now, I’m imagining Sheryl as Ava.

Is there some kind of lesson you’re trying to teach viewers about mentorship through these roles?</strong><strong><br></strong>My god. I think, through these roles, I have no problem saying, “My boss is half my age and I love her.” She’s actually teaching me something new. We actually work and learn together and I love that. Too many folks of older generations act like they’re going to be alive forever. You’re not going to be alive forever and it would do you wonderfully to teach them, mentor them, help them because, one, I want them to treat me real good when I get older. I want them to know that I was there for them. I want them to understand that auntie will never retire, so keep writing the roles, keep hiring me. I am actually Betty White Black.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbc1j82z002g3b6w3yoks79w@published data-word-count=7>This interview has been edited and condensed.</p><span role=tooltip id=annotation-1 data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/annotation/instances/clbcl4rm0000s3b6xug9wjxbw@published class=annotation data-editable=text>Anneka Di Lorenzo was named Penthouse Pet of the year in 1975.</span> <span role=tooltip id=annotation-2 data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/annotation/instances/clbcl4srp000u3b6x0gv5hwqa@published class=annotation data-editable=text>Ralph played Barbara Hanley in A Piece of the Action alongside Sidney Poitier, James Earl Jones, and Bill Cosby.</span> <span role=tooltip id=annotation-3 data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/annotation/instances/clbcl5g9b000x3b6xxmsw5a0p@published class=annotation data-editable=text>Tom Eyen was a Tony award winning playwright, known for Dreamgirls, who died of AIDS-related complications in 1991.</span> <span class=ambrose-short-hed>‘Auntie Will Never Retire’</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmny0tMSrsKVlnJqybr7ApaehZaaqubXB0Z5kn52jqba3rctnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
