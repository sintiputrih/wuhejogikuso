His birthday is July 24, 1956. The district has its administrative center in St. Petersburg. He served as Florida’s 44th governor from 2007 to 2011 for a period of four years.</p><p>Crist began his political career as a Republican (GOP) by serving in the Florida Senate from 1993 until 1999. He then made an unsuccessful bid to unseat Senator Bob Graham in 1998. Prior to winning the 2006 governor’s race, Crist served as Florida’s attorney general from 2003 to 2007 and as commissioner of education from 2001 to 2003.</p><p>Crist entered the U.S. Senate race while he was still governor. When the state GOP leadership opted not to support Crist’s election campaign, he lost ground to Marco Rubio in the polls after earlier leading the battle for the Republican nomination in 2010. In April 2010, Crist quit the Republican Party to run as an independent. He finished third in the final election, losing to Rubio with 30% of the vote to Rubio’s 49% and the Democratic nominee Kendrick Meek’s 20%. In January 2011, Crist’s stint as governor came to a conclusion.</p><h2>Is Charlie Crist married?</h2><p>Crist wed Amanda Morrow on July 31, 1979. In a year, they got divorced.
