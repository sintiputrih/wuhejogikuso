She also encouraged her millions of followers to continue their self-quarantine during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, adding at the end, "<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/stayhome/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=#stayhome class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">#stayhome</a>."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the photo of her and Malik, the couple color-coordinated with hints of red. Malik's outfit featured bright red stripes on his sweater and the sides of his pants, while Hadid wore a red crop top underneath an oversized blazer.

"It's allowed me to fill my days off with the little things that make me happy, like art, gardening, yoga, cooking, being outside, and spending time with my loved ones and animals without having to worry about things like what I'm wearing or how my hair looks, or being photographed or seen that day. Being away from the city and the public eye makes me feel like a kid again, and that freedom has been really healing for me."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
