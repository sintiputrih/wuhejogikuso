You will see your neighbors on the beach in California because no one wants to hang out in 116-degree weather. We end up on vacation every single year on my daughter’s birthday which means she rarely gets a homemade cake.</p><p>I believe EVERYONE needs to blow out a candle on their birthday. It’s as if a birthday isn’t complete without a poorly sung rendition of “Happy Birthday,” a few lit candles, and a birthday wish. It’s just tradition.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Berry-Chantilly-Cake-5-scaled.jpg alt="Homemade yellow cake layered with fluffy cream cheese whipped cream frosting and fresh berries.&nbsp;" width=2043 height=2560 data-pin-description="Homemade yellow cake layered with fluffy cream cheese whipped cream frosting and fresh berries.&nbsp;" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>So every year we have to buy a birthday cake for her on the road. &nbsp;We discovered her most beloved cake of all time at Whole Foods. It’s their famous Whole Foods Berry Chantilly Cake and you better believe I have asked the bakery chefs in California, Texas, and even Arizona how they make it.</p><p>After some research, a lot of questions, and studying the label, I went to work in the kitchen to create the <strong><span>Berry Chantilly Cream Cake</span></strong>. &nbsp;This is a simplified version of what they make at Whole Foods. It’s now the cake that BOTH of my girls request for their birthdays but I can make it at home!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DSC_0786edit.jpg alt="Berry Chantilly Cream Cake.

It’s the base of the cake so it has to be GOOD. &nbsp;I spent weeks testing out yellow cake recipes and came up with this gem —&nbsp;<a href=#>Yellow Birthday Cake</a>&nbsp;which takes on some creative methods. It’s such a soft, tender, fluffy, and moist cake.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Berry-Chantilly-Cake-7-scaled.jpg alt="Homemade yellow cake layered with fluffy cream cheese whipped cream frosting and fresh berries.&nbsp;" width=2376 height=2560 data-pin-description="Homemade yellow cake layered with fluffy cream cheese whipped cream frosting and fresh berries.&nbsp;" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The Chantilly Whipped Cream Frosting is when it gets REAL. &nbsp;This isn’t some overly sweet, stick-to-your-mouth kind of frosting. This Chantilly Frosting is light, and fluffy with the perfect amount of sweetness.</p><p>It’s a chantilly whipped cream frosting using heavy cream, which is whipped into soft peaks and folded into a sweetened cream cheese or mascarpone cheese and pure vanilla. It is HEAVENLY! My kids fight over who is going to lick the bowl.</p><p>When I asked the bakers at Whole Foods the ingredients in their famous chantilly cake frosting, they did tell me they used fresh whipped cream and mascarpone cheese. I have made this cake with both cream cheese and mascarpone cheese, and if you want to truly elevate your chantilly cream cake, I suggest using mascarpone cheese.</p><p>Warning: you can eat A LOT of this frosting without even batting an eye.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DSC_0804-copy.jpg alt="Berry Chantilly Cream Cake.

If you are baking two layers, then you will need to cook the cakes longer as they are thicker. If you are baking three layers, you will need to cook the layers for less time. &nbsp;Keep a cake tester or toothpick close by and check the middle of the cakes.</li><li><strong>When making the chantilly cream frosting, cream the cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla in a separate bowl.</strong> &nbsp;It is important to cream it long enough that it becomes silky smooth — about 4-5 minutes. &nbsp;After it is creamed, it can be gently folded in with the whipped cream.</li><li><strong>Use heavy cream and whip until it forms firm peaks.</strong> Add the powdered sugar and vanilla until incorporated.</li><li><strong>This frosting can benefit from being chilled for about 15 minutes before frosting the cake.</strong></li><li><strong>Always do a light “crumb coat” of frosting on the cake which means to do a light layer of frosting to cover the crumbs and then add the majority of frosting.</strong> &nbsp;I am a huge fan of an offset spatula. They don’t cost very much but makes it so much easier to frost a cake. Here is one of my favorites —&nbsp;<a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B00F0A6FYU data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Wilton Angled Icing Spatula</strong></a>.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DSC_0884-copy.jpg alt="Berry Chantilly Cream Cake.
