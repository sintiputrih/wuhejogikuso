They were seriously fun, and more importantly, they helped keep our minds from wandering all across the universe while we were working, talking on the phone or even just waiting around for a friend.</p><p>These days, you don’t really see fidget spinners anywhere. A big part of this, to be candid, is that they’re inconvenient to use and not exactly subtle. When you use a fidget spinner, everyone knows what’s going on. That’s why we are all about fidget rings emerging as the next big thing!</p><p>Fidget rings, also known as anxiety rings, look like regular rings you’d wear for style purposes — but they have a feature you can fidget with, such as a spinning element. If you’re feeling restless or having trouble paying attention and staying focused, having this small ring to play with may keep you on track and ease your mind, helping to soothe stress and keep you in the moment. And no one will have to know!</p><p>Want to see some examples on Amazon you can buy for yourself (or someone else) at affordable prices?
