And during an appearance on Wednesday's , <a class=hm-link href=#>Susannah Constantine</a> revealed she did something drastic to help deal with the heartache - cutting off her hair. "It is gutting, it is absolutely the worst feeling," explained Susannah, who was joined by her dancer partner <a class=hm-link href=#>Anton du Beke</a>. "I feel like I've been dumped by a boyfriend which is why I went and had my hair cut immediately afterwards."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f8e760fd364a-susannah-constantine-anton-loose-women-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=evozOv1Re4Nf2 data-wc=11><strong>Susannah Constantine with dance partner Anton du Beke on Loose Women</strong></p><p id=eI6xZ6po72cna data-wc=115>She added: "I was very, very, close to tears and when I watched it back and you think the professionals are immune to all of this because it's part of their job." Speaking about her pro dancer, the fashion expert remarked: "I watched Anton's face and saw how disappointed he looked. That was the time when I really cried because I felt like I had let him down." She continued: "Anton actually described it very well, it's a bit like having anaesthetic. I don't know if any of you had an epidural giving birth but it's like that. You're paralysed from the waist down. My brain disintegrated. It's the most terrifying thing I've ever done."</p><p id=eGZ7yWKsOFs0u data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Inside Strictly Come Dancing contestant Susannah Constantine's house</a></strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=eR8Lf7GWfnjaF data-wc=106>The pair were the first couple to leave Strictly after the judges voted to save Lee Ryan and Nadiya Bychkova following the dreaded dance off. After their last performance, Anton told the audience: "It's just all too brief, I have had the most fabulous time with Susannah, she is going to be a great loss to the show. Sadly someone's got to go but I wish it wasn't you because you're wonderful to be with. I'm going to miss spending time with you in the studio, we've had a great time, we've had enormous amounts of fun and you're wonderful and thank you very much indeed."</p><p id=ew8ikrnICrIPY data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Strictly's Kate Silverton reveals she feels 'liberated' thanks to recent weight loss</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
