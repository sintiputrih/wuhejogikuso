Alongside releasing her own songs, she was featured in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift</a>‘s “Karma” music video and was also included the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barbie</a>&nbsp;soundtrack with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicki Minaj</a>.

While the same could be said for this&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bronx-based rapper</a>, record labels were able to work with her to help her grow her craft. So, how much is this artist worth?</p><h2 id=h-what-is-ice-spice-s-net-worth-in-2023 data-injectable=false>What is Ice Spice’s net worth in 2023?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>As of writing, Ice Spice has released one EP and is listed as a supporting artist in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Doja Cat</a>‘s&nbsp;The Scarlet Tour. While the artist has over 47 million monthly listeners on Spotify, not many people appreciate her influence on younger listeners. Most notably&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye West</a>, who released a video&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ranting about his daughter dressing up as the rapper on TikTok.</a></p><p data-characters=570 data-current-count=933 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CelebrityNetWorth</a> reported that Ice Spice has a net worth of $2 million. While most of it comes from her music, the rapper also sells merch on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her website</a>, like t-shirts, hoodies, and thongs. Her value isn’t as high compared to other big-named artists, but it’s important to know that she only started her career a few years ago. Interestingly, she has the same net worth value as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MC Hammer,</a> a ’90s rapper known for the phrase “hammer time.” According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Richest</a>, he used to be worth around $25 million, until he filed for bankruptcy.</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=false>Ice Spice is still a new face in the music industry, and while many love her work, some criticize her due to the nature of her content. Regardless, the rapper has found success, and her reach will likely continue to as the years roll by. Hopefully, her music will continue to capture the ears of listeners and inspire a new generation of rappers, just as she was inspired by established performers in the industry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZmYsm6%2Fz6Kanqtdo7K1edaoqa2gXZ67bn6Pa2po</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
