The entire name of his&nbsp;sibling&nbsp;is Nathan Kane Samra who was taken in&nbsp;custody&nbsp;by the rapper when he was placed in&nbsp;foster care.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Did Eminem Diss NF aka Nathan Feuerstein?">Did Eminem Diss NF aka Nathan Feuerstein?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="How Are Eminem and NF Related?">How Are Eminem and NF Related?</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-eminem-diss-nf-aka-nathan-feuerstein></span>Did Eminem Diss NF aka Nathan Feuerstein?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Eminem was never happy about the&nbsp;comparison&nbsp;fans made between him and NF. About three years ago, Eminem released a rap from the album Kamikaze, The Ringer, where his fans identified it as a diss on NF, aka Nathan Feuerstein. In this album, Eminem showed his rage against several&nbsp;artists, so fans thought NF was among them.</p><p>Many fans identified this rap as a diss on NF, which they dissected from the last line mentioned above, where they believed that Marshall Mathers was calling NF a recovery clone.</p><p>In response, NF said, “First of all, there is no proof whether it was or was not diss towards me.” NF’s response to what fans identified as a diss on him was very positive, and his respect towards Eminem remained the same.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-are-eminem-and-nf-related></span>How Are Eminem and NF Related?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Except for NF and Eminem’s voices, which have been a matter of comparison, they are not related to each other. Even though they are not&nbsp;related&nbsp;by blood, they are both Michigan white&nbsp;rappers&nbsp;who use a similar style of writing and rapping.</p><p>Given their similar voices, NF and Eminem have been compared for a very long time since NF became a success in the rap industry and held the No. 1 spot on the Billboard chart in December 2019.</p><p>After the&nbsp;physical abuse&nbsp;and traumatic death of his&nbsp;mother, he began to find an escape in hip-hop music. Fans are drawn to his songs so strongly because of his terrible upbringing, which also ties the rising star to Eminem.</p><p>Even though they are unrelated, the rapper has huge respect for Eminem, which is evident from his tweet in 2017 that reads, “I can’t respect anyone that says Eminem is wack period.”</p><p>Besides this, the rapper’s writing style is also similar to Eminem’s as he also uses polysyllabic rhymes and self-deprecating lyrics, which we can see in Eminem’s as well. Therefore, many people believe that NF can fill the space left by Eminem in hip-hop.</p><p>One of the reasons why fans believed that Eminem and NF could be related is because Eminem has a half-blood&nbsp;brother&nbsp;whose name also starts with Nathan, although, it is not Nathan Feuerstein.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyZmXqmucinnKZllJ7AtHnNn2Sao5Fiu6LAx5qlZqKfnbtussSunKurpJq2r3nRmqepnaKoerOxy5qrnpxdlsButMClnWaaoqTBqbHRrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
