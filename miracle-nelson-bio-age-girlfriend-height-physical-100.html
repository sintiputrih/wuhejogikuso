Two episodes in, Miracle was able to win the hearts of the viewers with his soft-spoken demeanor and unparalleled dedication. After confessing he dislikes water in Physical 100 episodes 1 and 2, Miracle made it to the top six. His reasoning for entering the Netflix competition was that he is a dancer from Korea and “thought it would be fun.”</p><p>One viewer commented, “Rooting fiercely for Miracle, Bit-yeo-ul, and all the women here. Amazing stuff <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">#Physical100</a>.”</p><p>Another chimed in, “Miracle Dancer made top 6, proud of him, even if he might be a token lol.”</p><p>If we do win the show, then the cash prize is a whopping 300 million (won).</p><p>Before the show’s premiere, he wrote, “Please watch and support me as I strive to become number one among 99 people with the fastest and best physique in Korea.&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#Physical100&nbsp;</a><a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#netflix&nbsp;</a><a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#netflixkorea&nbsp;</a><a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#&nbsp;</a><a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>Physical100&nbsp;</a><a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#Netflix&nbsp;</a><a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#NetflixKorea #Physicalback&nbsp;</a><a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#># Physical100Miracle</a>.”</p><h3><strong>Miracle Nelson Job</strong></h3><p>Miracle Nelson works as a dance instructor, model, and actor. He has been working at The Krump Dance Studio since September 2012. Back in 2017, he was working at the Korean Cultural Center, Abuja where he taught K-pop, a Korean dance style that has set the world alight with its vibrant dancing and music.</p><p>At the time, Miracle said, “I have been into K-Pop for four years. Aside from dancing, there was a dream of becoming a singer. Everyone wanted to be Michael Jackson who sang and danced and this was what I found in K-Pop. To be a K-Pop artist you have to be a singer and a dancer and their costumes are fantastic.”</p><p>His love for dancing began in 2010 when he and his family participated in a popular TV dance show. “I Started dancing in 2010 when my family participated in the ‘Maltina Dance All’ and afterward I went to a dance school, Mobile Dance Academy in Jos, where I studied for two years and graduated with a diploma in dance,” he told Sunday Trust.</p><p>The dancer studied at National Open University and wishes to inspire the world with his moves, which started out as a hobby. In November 2020, Miracle performed in music videos for singer Park Su-bin and the South Korean boy band OnlyOneOf. A cast member of The Physical 100 is employed by SunJay Entertainment.</p><p>Armed with a certificate in dance and enough energy to burn, Miracle was uniquely poised for the next big thing that would come his way. And then four years ago he discovered K-Pop. “A friend introduced me to K-Pop, he showed me a clip and asked if we would like to participate in the contest.”</p><p>He was alluding to the K-Pop Competition in Abuja, which was hosted by the Korean Cultural Center. Miracle and his friend set about organizing a team to compete since the money was alluring enough and passion was present. He took over as the group’s leader, and under his guidance, they finished second that year.</p><p>The next year, Miracle led his squad to another runners-up spot on the podium, proving that he had discovered his destiny. They had the opportunity to travel to Korea that year to compete for Nigeria in the K-Pop global championship. Miracle would have missed the trip if it had happened because he was contracted to perform in another dancing program.</p><p>However, the trip never happened. In 2016, under his direction, his group won the Nigerian K-Pop tournament and qualified to represent Nigeria at the K-Pop global championship in Korea.</p><p>Talking about his education, he attended National Open University Nigeria. He studied <span class="t-14 t-normal"><span aria-hidden=true>Peace studies and conflict resolution and graduated in 2016.</span></span></p><p>However, along the line, Miracle got in touch with fitness and it became a hobby for him. He has a <a href=#>YouTube</a> channel where he posts workout videos. He won the Champion Trainer Award from INBA Global Korea, but&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a> that “winning is not the point.” Physical 100 is not Miracle’s first TV debut as he appeared on Dance With Peter at the age of 21.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Miracle Nelson?</strong></h3><p>Reportedly born in 1994, Miracle Nelson reached 28 age in 2022.
