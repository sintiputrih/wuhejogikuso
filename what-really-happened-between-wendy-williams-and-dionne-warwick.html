The star has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">feuded with a number of celebrities</a> throughout her 30-year career, and she doesn't appear to be stopping anytime time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether it's her notorious <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">feud with Nicki Minaj</a> or the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">true diva herself, Mariah Carey</a>, Wendy has no limits! Well, now it appears as if Mariah isn't the only icon Wendy has found herself feeding with.</p><p>The Wendy Show host is now in hot waters with none other than Dionne Warwick, however, it appears as if the two have been involved in a squabble for quite some time. So, what led to the feud? Let's find out!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>This Is Why Wendy Williams’ Talk Show Was Once Almost Canceled</a></span></p><h2 id=the-wendy-x-dionne-feud-explained>The Wendy x Dionne Feud Explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dionne-Warwick-Wendy-Williams-Feud-e1616185115465.jpeg><p>The last year has certainly given us some of the most jaw-dropping news we have endured in a while, and well, a feud between Wendy Williams and Dionne Warwick was certainly not something any of us could have seen coming!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While we know Wendy Williams has been messy a time&nbsp;or two too many, it seems as if she has met her match! The talk show host has taken any opportunity to express her opinions when it comes to the entertainment business, a gimmick that has gotten Wendy in trouble countless times.</p><p>During the host's starter segment, Hot Topics, Wendy took the moment to speak on Dionne Warwick and her most recent Twitter activity. The singer-songwriter has been quite vocal online, chiming in about news stories, messaging celebrities, and now, throwing shade!</p><p>Wendy not only brought up Warwick's Twitter use, which she spoke about in a kind way, but it was also her dig regarding Dionne's 2002 marijuana charge that set the singer off.</p><p>Considering Dionne is a Twitter lover, it was only fitting that she'd take to her account to speak on Wendy's most recent comments. In a two-part tweet, Dionne made it clear that she wishes for Wendy to simply <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">keep her name out of her mouth!</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Wendy Williams Nicknamed ‘Windy’ After Farting And Burping Live On-Air</a></span></p><p>Fans are now wondering what sparked the feud, as it couldn't have been about the one Hot Topics segment. Well, after further investigation, it appears as if Wendy and the Wendy Show team believe Dionne holds resentment towards Wendy after she didn't stand up for her during her surprise appearance.</p><p>While Dionne is a legend, we doubt Wendy remaining seated during her time on the show is the catalyst to all of this! Dionne is also not the only icon to have felt the wrath of Wendy's messy ways!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Williams has also come for legends such as Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. The former <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">radio host came for Mariah back in 2001</a> when she accused Mimi of having plastic surgery and made disparaging comments regarding her breakdown, hence Mariah's lyric in Touch My Body saying "all up in my business like a Wendy interview."</p><p>Although Wendy comes off as harsh, this has been her schtick for over 3 decades, and we doubt she'll be stopping anytime soon, despite Dionne's warning.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Did Whitney Houston Really Hate Wendy Williams?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr%2BmrculsGagkaW9prrEnWSbnaSssqa6jLCcp5ypYsSquMuimKarXZa7pXnDoqanppVixKK%2B1qKapGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
