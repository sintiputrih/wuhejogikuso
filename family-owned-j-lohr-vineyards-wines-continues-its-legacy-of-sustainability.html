Lohr.</p><p>Cynthia Lohr, the Chief Brand Officer of J. Lohr adds, “For consumers to know that our wines are made from certified sustainable grapes from certified sustainable vineyards and crafted in certified sustainable wineries gives them a degree of faith that we are conscientious about all our practices.”</p><p>In 2020, J.

Today, they continue to carry out their mission of “respecting nature, nurturing balance” and encourage consumers to get involved.</p><p>“We actually have a nice campaign going on currently called Take the Pledge, where we invite you as a consumer to take a look at what things you can do at home. What can you do to use less energy, use less water, reduce, reuse, recycle, and volunteer for your community, said Steve Lohr.</p><p>He added, “All these things that you can make a little difference yourself, but when multiplied by 1000s, or millions of people, make a huge difference.”</p><p>For more information, visit here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnlpa6qrjYZqawppWZeqt5y6ifq2WmnrumxcCrm6xlp567pr%2BMnKanrJmjwqa%2FjKKrrGWcmrSir9hmpp9lo6rAta3Ip5iboZyewbp7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
