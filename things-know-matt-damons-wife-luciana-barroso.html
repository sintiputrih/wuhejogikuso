Pataky, who is married to Thor star Chris Hemsworth, said that after she met Barroso "through mutual friends," they hit it off so well that they started vacationing together. We're not just talking about going halves on a beach house at the shore. They've&nbsp;traveled to Costa Rica, Monaco, and Australia.</p><p>Much of the famous friendship has to do with the families being a great match. Both Pataky and Barroso are native Spanish speakers, which must come in handy when it's time to complain about Hemsworth and Damon right in front of their faces. Then there's the kid situation: The Hemsworth-Pataky brood has three, and the Damon-Barroso clan has four. Though getting a table at a restaurant may be tough, it sounds like they have a blast together.</p><p>In fact, Pataky also said that she and Barroso have become so tight they even got matching tattoos. "A few friends, we got together and we felt like we had to have something to remind us of those great moments we stayed together, and we decided to get a little tattoo [of three dots on their pinkies] all together and we say 'We'll have to do one every year,'" she told the tab.&nbsp;</p><p>Sorry, but we have to ask: Do Damon and Hemsworth have matching tats? Sub-question:&nbsp;How does Ben Affleck feel about it if they do? &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlgbYFwwMeipaCrXaC7sMOMppitrF2Zrq67zaxksKGWmnqtwcKimKeZXZeus77OrKZo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
