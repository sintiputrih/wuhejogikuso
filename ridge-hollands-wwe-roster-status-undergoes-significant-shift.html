Wrestlers from NXT have made appearances on Raw and SmackDown, while main roster stars have transitioned to NXT to rejuvenate their careers.</p><p>Ridge Holland, who split from The Brawling Brutes in November, has been a recent example of this crossover. However, Holland’s stint in NXT differs from previous examples of main roster stars moving to the brand due to his participation in NXT’s live event circuit, which is relatively rare for such transitions.</p><p>Holland has competed in NXT’s live events, facing Joe Coffey in Fort Pierce, Florida, on November 13, and squaring off against Trick Williams at another event on November 5. In comparison, Baron Corbin, who joined NXT in June 2022, has only participated in two NXT live events in over six months.</p><p>This differs from previous cases like Mustafa Ali and Dana Brooke, former WWE stars who never wrestled at untelevised NXT branded events during their time in the brand before their releases.</p><p>Holland is scheduled to face Coffey on NXT TV on January 16, marking his first match since the “injury” angle involving NXT Champion Ilja Dragunov a month earlier.</p><p>How do you think Ridge Holland’s transition between NXT and the main roster, including his participation in NXT’s live event circuit, might affect his career trajectory and potential opportunities in WWE?
