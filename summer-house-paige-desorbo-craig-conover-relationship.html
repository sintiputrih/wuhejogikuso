Bravo blessed fans with the spin-off series Winter House, which birthed a relationship between Southern Charm's <a href=#>Craig Conover and Paige DeSorbo</a> who is known for <a href=#>her podcast "Giggly Squad"</a> and her popular <a href=#>Amazon live stream fashion hauls</a>, in addition to Summer House. Bravoholics got to see the pair develop a friendship in Vermont and now while in the Hamptons they have turned it up a notch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Bravoholics Dream Came True With ‘Southern Charm’ And ‘Summer House’ Entering The ‘Winter House’</a></span></p><p>However, Paige's Italian stallion friend Andrea Denver just became Summer House's newest roommate! As we all know, Paige ultimately chose Craig and the two are happy as can be, but watching it all play out on television isn't easy. Craig Conover has admitted that with the spill of the Winter House drama pouring into Summer House it might be too hard to watch. No man wants to watch his woman juggling two attractive men... even if he was the winner.</p><h2 id=39-winter-house-39-drama-for-paige-desorbo-and-craig-conover><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>'Winter House' Drama For Paige DeSorbo And Craig Conover</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paige DeSorbo went into the Winter House looking for a good time. When she saw the 6′ 2″ model, it was kind of a no-brainer. Craig Conover was in a relationship with Natalie Hegnauer, so he didn't have a chance to pursue Paige. However, when the show was done filming, Craig called it quits with Natalie and went after this Giggly Squad girl. It's clear this southerner had his eyes on this fashion guru and wasn't about to let his chance slip away.</p><h2 id=andrea-denver-joins-39-summer-house-39><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Andrea Denver Joins 'Summer House'</span></h2><p>It's not every day your holiday fling follows you onto your reality show. Paige DeSorbo just filmed her fourth season of the hit Bravo series and is a fan-favorite. Andrea Denver joining the show was a shock to many, but he did add plenty of spice to the series. Paige found herself in a bit of a love triangle between Denver and Conover. Viewers will soon see her romance with Denver fizzle out as she falls head over heals for Craig.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Paige DeSorbo From 'Summer House' And Her Amazon Livestream Fashion Hauls</a></span></p><h2 id=craig-conover-visits-the-summer-house><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Craig Conover Visits The Summer House</span></h2><p>Craig will appear on an episode of Summer House and no one is ready... especially Andrea Denver. Conover is going to shake up the house a bit with his presence. Denver feels misled by Paige and Craig's newfound relationship and will ultimately confront Craig. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DeSorbo and Conover are seen </a>going on a sweet date where they both look shy and nervous. “I really like Craig,” DeSorbo explains “But I also like Andrea.”</p><h2 id=craig-conover-39-s-thoughts-on-watching-39-summer-house-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Craig Conover's Thoughts On Watching 'Summer House'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Craig is the first one to admit that he gets jealous about anyone who was romantically involved with Paige. It's also not exactly fun to watch your current girlfriend date other people on TV. Conover admitted, “I don’t ever get jealous,” he said on his Pillows and Beer podcast. But he explained, “I get real jealous of Paige. Because of the life we live.”</p><p>“Craig can’t watch a TV show anymore because …” DeSorbo started. That’s when Conover added, “I won’t watch Summer House.”</p><p>“Oh I wasn’t talking about reality TV,” she said.</p><p>“Yeah, she dated someone from my f****** favorite show!” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Conover then exclaimed, but didn’t reveal which show</a>. “And I was like wait what, why did you tell me that?” So basically Paige has ruined all reality television and scripted shows for Craig!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paige-desorbo-39-s-thoughts-on-watching-it-back><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Paige DeSorbo's Thoughts On Watching It Back</span></h2><p>Paige is looking forward to seeing their romance blossom on air. "It will be interesting to watch just how excited I was when we first started talking, and how nervous and giddy I would get when he would come and visit or even just call and text me," she reflects. "So I'm really excited to see that because when you're in it, you're so in your own head. But knowing the ending, I'm excited to watch it." Craig probably needs to change his mindset to this, so he can enjoy the show!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Biggest Reveals From The 'Summer House' Season Six Trailer</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paige-desorbo-and-craig-conover-adore-long-distance><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Paige DeSorbo And Craig Conover Adore Long Distance</span></h2><p>Paige lives in NYC while Craig is based in Charleston South Carolina. Somehow these two lovebirds have romanticized long distance relationships. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We actually love long-distance.</a> We’re two people that are very independent and have so much going on during the week,” Paige explained. “When we get, like, Monday through Friday to get all of our things done, and then I hop on a plane Friday morning, it’s fun. I feel like we’re more present with each other when we are together. We’re not on our phones, and we plan and do fun things.”</p><h2 id=where-do-paige-desorbo-and-craig-conover-stand-today><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Where Do Paige DeSorbo And Craig Conover Stand Today?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Craig and Paige fly back and forth to visit each other and are enjoying spending time together.
