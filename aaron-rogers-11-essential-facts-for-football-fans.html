But first, something for comparison. When <a href=#>ESPN</a> looked back at the career of Green Bay quarterback Bart Starr, they called him one of the team's most beloved players — even after his retirement. In his final year — and after five championships — he was given his highest salary: $100,000. That was in 1971 and adjusted for <a href=#>inflation</a>, that's just shy of $700,000 in today's money.</p><p dir=ltr>When <a href=#>Spotrac</a> took a look at Rodgers' career earnings, that started out with an impressive $2,350,000 for his rookie year. While his salary fluctuated, there were some high-earning years in his 18-year career, including 2018 — worth $66.9 million. As of 2022, his to-date career earnings totaled an impressive $305,608,010, and when they estimated his earnings through the 2026 season, they put the total at $450,373,010 — in other words, nearly half a billion dollars.</p><p dir=ltr>That puts something else in perspective, too. In 2021, he was fined $14,650 for violating the league's COVID-19 rules. (It was officially called a fine for Conduct Detrimental to the Team.) While that might sound like a lot, it was actually only 0.004% of his earnings to date.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kGxwbGljZK6ivs6nZKunl5q%2FtHmQamSeq6Oau7W1wKVkn5mTqcBuss6rZJ%2Bnn6mvorjLZp2apqNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
