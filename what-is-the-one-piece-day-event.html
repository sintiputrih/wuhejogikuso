Luffy, elastic captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, as he and his crew set sail across the sea in search of the fabled One Piece treasure and meet all kinds of kooky characters and terrifying rivals along the way.</p><p>The original manga by Eiichiro Oda began back in 1997 with an anime adaptation premiering shortly after in 1999. Since then, One Piece has blown up into an enormous franchise beloved by fans around the world. As of August 2022, it became the best-selling manga series in history. That same year, One Piece Film: Red was released in Japanese theaters to become one of the highest-grossing anime films of all time.</p><p>With success like this, it's no wonder we celebrate <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One Piece Day</a> every year.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter/@Eiichiro_Staff</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the "One Piece Day" event?</h2><p>Though both the manga and the anime have been around for several decades, One Piece Day only came about in 2017 during the 20th anniversary of the manga's debut.
