Their argument is that in plays, often times fictional names were hyphenated.</p><p>Francis Bacon, the philosopher who served as both Attorney General and Lord Chancellor of London, is often cited as the mostly likely alternative author, but other candidates have proposed: two earls, Edward de Vere and William Stanely, and even <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth I</a>.</p><p>The fact remains however that, “No one in Shakespeare’s lifetime or the first two hundred years after his death expressed the slightest doubt about his authorship,” Jonathan Bate <a href=#>wrote</a> in the Genius of Shakespeare.</p><p>Next, read about <a href=#>the four most enduring conspiracy theories</a> in history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony4rdJmqqGZm5rAsbHAq5xmqpWWuQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
