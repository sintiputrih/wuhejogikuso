(New York, 42, initially rose to fame on VH1’s Flavor of Love.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Kandy-Muse-Names-House-of-Villains-Costar-Who-Would-Do-Best-on-Drag-Race-2.jpg><p>The series premiered last year and <a href=#>follows the titular “villains”</a> as they live together while competing for $200,000 and the title of America’s Ultimate Supervillain. Though the show is full of boisterous personalities, Kandy said she still made friends in the house even as she was competing against her roommates.</p><p>“Camille [and I] definitely got along really, really well,” Kandy told Us in an <a href=# rel=noopener>interview hosted by BetUS</a>. “I got along with everyone for the most part. Yes, there was drama, but I think everyone in there had a mutual respect for each other, specifically for me, because they knew I was getting in drag. And they were also fascinated with the art of drag, how I went from being my boy self to being this glamorous diva. So, everyone for the most part really appreciated me. Doesn’t mean we didn’t get into it!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Kandy-Muse-Names-House-of-Villains-Costar-Who-Would-Do-Best-on-Drag-Race-4.jpg><p>While some reality stars might be insulted by the villain label, Kandy isn’t afraid to embrace it after her headline-making turns on RuPaul’s Drag Race season 13 and All Stars season 8.</p><p>“I knew that on Drag Race I was considered a little villain, which, hey, I’ll take it. Because villains are always the most iconic ones,” Kandy explained. “And TV shows and movies, they’re always the most memorable ones. So when I got asked to do House of Villains, I was like, ‘Oh, absolutely. There’s no doubt, let’s do it!’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Kandy-Muse-Names-House-of-Villains-Costar-Who-Would-Do-Best-on-Drag-Race-3.jpg><p>After House of Villains wraps up, Kandy has her sights set <a href=#>on another reality show</a>: Celebrity Big Brother.</p><p>“I think start off with that one,” she told Us. “Here’s the thing: I know there’s The Challenge and there’s all these really physical competition shows — which, let me tell you, physical competition is hard. We did a few physical challenges on House of Villains, and I don’t know how Wes from The Real World goes back every other season to do it because I could never do the physical part of a competition. I’m good on that one. So a little Big Brother moment, that’s cute for me.”</p><p>House of Villains season 2 premieres on E! this fall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKappSueq7B0p5kp5mdmsButM6uqp5ln5t6t7XLpZiipqNisLC%2F05qpZq%2BYpLFusM5mmZ6rpGK8r3nDq5igZaKWsKZ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
