Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio threw down at the show of shows, and Rey won that match. That being said, the two are far from finished.</p><p>The Mysterio Family has a rich history in lucha libre wrestling. One of the most popular gimmick matches from that world might find its way to WWE eventually.</p><p>Rey Mysterio recently appeared <a href=#>on the Impaulsive podcast</a> where he discussed where his feud with Dominik Mysterio might end up. If Mr. 6-1-9 has his way, then it could be a mask vs hair match that settles things between him and his son.</p><p>“Maybe I put my mask on the line against his hair, which is some lucha culture. If I lose that, I take my mask off. If he loses, he shaves his hair off. That might be interesting.”</p><p>Rey Mysterio went on to throw a little shade at his son, and speak on the odds that he would take that match. “He talks a lot of crap. Why not? Back it up… I will pitch it out. I’ll challenge him. Straight up.”</p><p>Dominik Mysterio has grown his hair out to a pretty nice length at this point. It’s never been incredibly short in WWE, but the Judgment Day stable certainly gave Dominik Mysterio a reason to avoid the barber. Perhaps, he will be forced to get a haircut if his rivalry with Rey Mysterio turns out like this.</p><p>What’s your take on a possible mask vs hair match for Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio?
