Well, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hunter x Hunter</a></strong> is that anime and part of its appeal lies in the fact that we love some characters and love to hate others. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">We just can’t help but want to learn more about them</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>At some point, Yoshihiro Togashi nearly dethroned <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the big three of Shonen</a>. In fact, many anime and manga fans consider Hunter x Hunter to be one of the masterpieces that transform “the big trio” into a quartet, and I’m inclined to agree, especially when you consider that the main characters in Hunter x Hunter are much younger than most Shonen protagonists.</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=779 data-injectable=true>In reality, Togashi <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">never confirmed any birthdates in Hunter x Hunter</a>. However, we’ve come across a certain “Hunter × Hunter Hunter Association Official Issue: Hunter’s Guide; Character & World Official Databook,” which is unofficial by all means but holds some likely real information about our favorite Hunter x Hunter characters. And these are their alleged ages.</p><h2 id=h-how-old-is-gon-freecss data-injectable=false>How old is Gon Freecss?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gon-Hunter-x-Hunter.jpg><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true><strong>Age:</strong> 11 (debut), 14 (present)<br><strong>Height:</strong> 154 cm (5′ 1″)<br><strong>Birthday:</strong> May 5<br><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Taurus</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>The moment we meet our protagonist, Gon, we learn that he’s 11 years old. Bright, full of energy and hope, Gon is the perfect personification of a child ready to take on new challenges. As the story progresses, we discover that he ages throughout the events, reaching 12 and beyond. In the current arc, he’s likely around 14 years old. Allegedly born on May 5, he is a Taurus, perfectly befitting his hard-headed and loyal personality.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How old is Killua Zoldyck?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/killua-hunter-x-hunter.jpg><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true><strong>Age:</strong> 11 (debut), 14 (present)<br><strong>Height:</strong> 158 cm (5′ 2″)<br><strong>Birthday:</strong> July 7<br><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Cancer</p><p data-characters=501 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>Much like Gon, we meet Killua at the tender age of 11, but as the story rolls on, we see him grow <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">from a little kid to a full-fledged teenager</a>. According to the Hunter x Hunter databook, Killua is slightly taller than Gon, and he was allegedly born on July 7, making him Cancer – which is all kinds of surprising. Even though he doesn’t fit the typical Cancer mold, Killua’s commitment to his pals proves that, no matter where you’re from, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">kindness can just be part of who you are</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How old is Kurapika?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Kurapika-Hunter-x-Hunter.jpg><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true><strong>Age:</strong> 11 (Volume 0), 17 (Heavens Arena), 19 (present)<br><strong>Height:</strong> 171 cm (5’7.5″)<br><strong>Birthday:</strong> April 4<br><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Aries</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>We’ve seen Kurapika in all stages of life. We first run into him at 17 in Heavens Arena, but the Volume 0 prequel dives into Kurapika’s heartbreaking clan story at the tender age of 11, where his whole family faces a tragic end. According to the databook and timeline, Kurapika should be around 19. He was also allegedly born on April 4, making him an Aries – which does make sense, even with his calm disposition most of the time.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How old is Leorio?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Leorio-Hunter-x-Hunter.jpg><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true><strong>Age:</strong> 19 (debut), 21 (present)<br><strong>Height:</strong> 193 cm (6’4”)<br><strong>Birthday:</strong> March 3<br><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Pisces</p><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>Leorio is the oldest of our main characters, clocking in at 19 during the Heavens Arena arc, but we see him at 21 in the current Succession contest arc. Even though he’s quite a bit older than Gon and Killua, his maturity level is right in sync with the kids. Regardless, he’s not shy about pledging to protect the whole crew. Leorio is also evidently the tallest of the group, and he was allegedly born on March 3, making him a Pisces.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How old is Hisoka?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/hisoka-hunter-x-hunter.jpg><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true><strong>Age:</strong> 28 (debut), 30 (present)<br><strong>Height:</strong> 190+ cm (6’3”)<br><strong>Birthday:</strong> June 6<br><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Gemini</p><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>Hisoka’s age remains a well-guarded secret, with no disclosure even in the unofficial databook. However, based on fan speculation and timeline analysis, it’s believed he’s around 28 years old, hitting the age of 30 in the current arc. While his height has been somewhat confirmed to be over 190cm, the exact measurement remains undisclosed. According to the databook, Hisoka’s birthday falls on June 6, meaning he is a Gemini.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How old is Illumi Zoldyck?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/illumi-hunter-x-hunter.jpg><p data-characters=105 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true><strong>Age:</strong> 24 (debut), 26 (present)<br><strong>Height:</strong> 185 cm (6’1”)<br><strong>Birthday:</strong> Unknown<br><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Unknown</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>Befitting of a Zoldyck, little is known about the eldest sibling’s life. According to the unofficial databook, it appears the oldest Zoldyck sibling was 24 at the start of the series, placing him at 26 in the most recent manga arc. As for his birthday and zodiac sign, such details remain unexplored in all corners of the internet. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">He’s also a bit too terrifying</a> to make any of us pry in his personal business.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How old is Chrollo Lucifer?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/chrollo-hunter-x-hunter.jpg><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true><strong>Age:</strong> 26 (debut), 28 (present)<br><strong>Height:</strong> 177 cm (5’10”)<br><strong>Birthday:</strong> Unknown<br><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Unknown</p><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>Much like the Zoldycks, it’s challenging to pinpoint some details of Chrollo’s life—<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">especially considering he hails from Meteor City</a>, where there are virtually no official records of the population in the junkyard. Nonetheless, his age was confirmed in the story, and we meet him at 26 years old, making him 28 currently. As we know, he is shorter than Hisoka and Illumi, however, details such as his birth date and Zodiac sign remain well-hidden secrets, even in the databook.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How old was Meruem?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/meruem-hunter-x-hunter.jpg><p data-characters=70 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false><strong>Age:</strong> 40 days<br><strong>Height:</strong> Unknown<br><strong>Birthday:</strong> Unknown<br><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Unknown</p><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=775 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, all we know about Meruem is that he was born during the Chimera Ant arc, which lasted about 40 days—making him 40 days old until the time of his passing. Details such as his height, birthday, or zodiac sign were never disclosed in either the story or the databook, although <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">we do know he was quite muscular due to his Chimera roots</a>, albeit his frame was smaller than many other Chimeras.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How old is Biscuit Krueger?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Biscuit-Krueger-hunter-x-hunter.jpg><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true><strong>Age:</strong> 57 (debut), 58-59 (present)<br><strong>Height:</strong> 155 cm (5’1”), and 220 cm (7’2”) in her true form<br><strong>Birthday:</strong> Unknown<br><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Unknown</p><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>Don’t be fooled by her sweet look and cute outfits because Biscuit is quite different from what meets the eye. Although she appears to be around the same age as Killua and Gon in the Greed Island arc—or even younger—Bisky is actually past her mid-age. The reason why we can’t tell is that she uses her powers to change her appearance, transforming from her true muscular and incredibly tall form to her preferred appearance of a much smaller and dainty, young-looking kid.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How old was Netero?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Netero-Hunter-x-Hunter.jpg><p data-characters=89 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false><strong>Age:</strong> 110-120+<br><strong>Height:</strong> 160 cm (5’3”)<br><strong>Birthday:</strong> Unknown<br><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Unknown</p><p data-characters=509 data-current-count=898 data-injectable=false>We actually don’t know Isaac Netero’s birthday, which means we also don’t know his zodiac sign, but truly, that’s almost irrelevant when you consider his age. Netero is the oldest character in Hunter x Hunter, and while he certainly looks like an old man from the moment we meet him back in Heavens Arena, we could have never guessed he was over 120 years old. In the anime, he claims to be 100, but apparently, he’s been saying that for over 20 years anyway. We see you, Netero.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6erZ6qqWK1trrTnqlmsF2dwq%2FAxKtkppmZo3qktMCrmJyslafAbq3GnmShnZmctbV5waKpraCUlsZurc2dZLOnlJ6upHnSop6nZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
