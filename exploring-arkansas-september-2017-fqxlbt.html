VENTURING INTO A CAVE FULL OF WATER.</p><p>>> SPRINGFED AND FULL OF SALAMANDERS MAKES THIS PARTICULAR CAVE QUITE UNIQUE .</p><p>>> FOR OBVIOUS REASONS, DOCTOR DAVE, WE ARE NOT GOING TO DISCLOSE THELOCATION OF THIS PARTICULAR CAVE .THIS IS FOR SCIENTIFIC PURPOSES ONLY BUT TELL US ABOUT A CAVE LIKE THIS THAT IS FILLED WITH SPRING WATER AND ALL THE CREATURES WE ARE SEEING .</p><p>>> OKAY, LIKE MANY SPRINGS IN ARKANSAS, OFTEN SPRING WATER PASSES BEFORE TEAMS BEFORE REACHING THE SPRINGS.IN THIS CASE THE SPRING OF THIS CAVE COMES OUT BELOW THE CAVE ITSELF .</p><p>WITH WATERS LOWING ALL THE WAY THROUGH.</p><p>SO IT MEANS THAT AS WE ARE GOING THREE, THROUGH, THIS IS THE ONLY PART OF THE TRIBUTARY.</p><p>BUT THIS PARTICULAR SPRING CARRIES A LOT OF WHAT WE CALL ANTHROPOLOGY.</p><p>THAT PROVIDES FOOD FOR THESE GUYS, WE'VE GOT LOTS AND LOTS OF SALAMANDERS HERE.</p><p>IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO FIND MORE THAN 100 SALAMANDERS ON ONE OF THESE TRIPS AND THIS CAVE IS ONLY 400 METERS LONG SO THIS IS THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION ZONE THAT I KNOW OF.</p><p>YOU SEE THE CAVE, SALAMANDERS, BRIGHT ORANGE ONES HERE NEAR THE ENTRANCE AND AS WE MOVE FURTHER IN WE WILL STILL SEE THEM THROUGHOUT THE CAVE BUT AS WE GET DEEPER IN A START TO GIVE WAY TO OTHER SALAMANDERS.</p><p>THESE ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE NO PIGMENTS, OR ARE LIGHTER PINK AND AS THEY AGE THEIR EYES GET RUN OVER WITH TISSUE SO THEY BECOME BLIND, THEY'RE NOT BORN THAT WAY.</p><p>IF YOU LOOK AT THE LITTLE TINY BABIES, THE CAVE SALAMANDERS HERE AND SOME OF THE OTHERS, THEY ALL LOOK PRETTY MUCH THE SAME.</p><p>>> THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RENOT DISCLOSING THE LOCATION OF THIS K .</p><p>IT'S STUFF LIKE THIS, A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND THIS IS ALL SPRAYING UP.</p><p>NO REGARD FOR A CAVE SYSTEM.</p><p>ABSOLUTELY AWESOME.</p><p>>> THIS IS MY FIRST TIME IN THIS PARTICULAR CAVE BUT LAST SUMMER I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GO WITH DOCTOR THOMAS ON THESE EXPEDITIONS AND I GUESS MY FAVORITE PART OF COMING IN HERE AND SEEING ALL THE LIGHT AND THESE SALAMANDERS, I DIDN'T SEE ANY BASS THIS YEAR BUT IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SPEND THE SUMMER, I'LL TELL YOU THAT.</p><p>>> HERE I'VE BEEN TALKING WITH DOCTOR THOMAS FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS.</p><p>AND WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS CAVE IS THE AMOUNT OF LIFE THAT'S IN HERE AND IN THE OTHER CAVE WE GO TO THERE'S NOT MANY ORGANISMS.</p><p>YOU DO WALK IN AND YOU COUNT 20 OF THE SALAMANDERS RIGHT OFF THE BAT.</p><p>SO YOU SEE ALL THE LITTLE PATIENTS SWIMMING AROUND.</p><p>>> I TEACH AT LYON COLLEGE AND WHEN I FIRST CAME ALONG WITH DAVE, IT WAS ONE OF THESE SERVICE PROJECTS AND I WAS JUST TAKEN WITH, IT'S LIKE A DIFFERENT WORLD DOWN HERE.</p><p>YOU HAVE ALL THE TIME AND SEE THE DIFFERENCE AND IT'S LIKE ANOTHER WORLD ALMOST.</p><p>NOW WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE A LITTLE BIT AND GET THE NATURE OF THESE PICTURES.</p><p>I'M DOWN HERE WITH MY CAT.</p><p>>> IT MIGHT BE YOUR UNDERWATER LIGHTING OVER THERE.</p><p>[MUSIC] >> THE CAVE SALAMANDER IS ONE SPECIES AND ACTUALLY IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A MISNOMER BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO SPEND ITS WHOLE LIFE HERE.</p><p>WE HAVE BROWN SALAMANDERS AS WELL.LONGTAIL, DARK SIDED SALAMANDERS.YOU WILL SEE THOSE ALONG WITH THE YELLOWISH ONES.</p><p>WE GOT THOSE TWO SUBSPECIES.</p><p>THERE'S THE WESTERN SLIMY SALAMANDER, THE RED SALAMANDER, THE OZARK ZIGZAG SALAMANDER.</p><p>MOST OF THEM TEND TO BE BOUND BACK TOWARD THE ENTRANCE.</p><p>THEY USE THAT CAVE IS SHELTER AND A PLACE TO LIVE.</p><p>>> I DIDN'T EXPECT THERE TO BE SO MANY CAVES WHEN I CAME TO THE COLLEGE AND IT'S A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT.</p><p>ALL THE ORGANISMS THAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW EXISTED AND IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY COOL EXPERIENCE.</p><p>I HAD TO WORK HARD TO GET HERE.</p><p>IT'S JUST VERY ENJOYABLE.</p><p>IT'S LIKE A TALENT, LIKE INDIANA JONES.</p><p>IT'S A LOT OF FUN AND WE ALSO LEARN SO MUCH.</p><p>>> WHAT ARE YOUR ASPIRATIONS FOR YOUR TEACHERS?</p><p>>> I WANT TO BE GOING INTO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE.</p><p>>> THERE YOU GO.</p><p>>> FOR FIRST TIME STUDENTS EXPLORING THE SALAMANDER CAVE, DOCTOR DAVE THOMAS HAS AN INITIATION.</p><p>GOING THROUGH A NARROW PASSAGEWAY THAT MOSTLY FILLED WITH WATER.</p><p>>> THE STREAMS YOU HEAR ARE JUST COLD WATER.</p><p>>> OOHHH!</p><p>>> OOHHH!</p><p>>> YES, ALL INTO THE CAVE OF THIS, NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN.</p><p>>> CAVE, THIS IS WHERE I DRAW THE LINE.</p><p>SORRY.</p><p>>> IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR THE RETURN OF THOSE CAVE SALAMANDERS, I MEAN SWIMMERS.</p><p>>>.</p><p>[LAUGHTER] OH MY.</p><p>IT'S A CAVE PLANT.</p><p>>> REFRESHING.</p><p>THERE HE IS.</p><p>>> YOU ARE OFFICIALLY INITIATED.</p><p>>> I'VE ALWAYS SAID THE WONDERS OF THE NATURAL STATE NOT ONLY ABOVEGROUND BUT UNDERGROUND AS WELL.</p><p>>>.</p><p>[MUSIC] A BIG CHUNK OF ARKANSAS HISTORY DURING THE FIRST 100 YEARS OF STATEHOOD FROM 1836 TO 1936 WAS OF COURSE THE PLANTATION CULTURE AND AN IDEAL LOCATION TO EXPERIENCE THAT HISTORY FIRSTHAND IS HE'S GOT PLANTATION SETTLEMENT.</p><p>THE SCOTT PLANTATION SETTLEMENT IS A RELOCATION OF 25 STRUCTURES THAT WERE ON WORKING PLANTATIONS AROUND THE SCOTT AREA.</p><p>ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY STUDENTS FROM CENTRAL ELEMENTARY PAID A VISIT AND WATCHED AS THE PAGES OF THEIR HISTORY BOOKS CAME ALIVE.</p><p>>> WHAT THEY DID IS THEY CAME UP WITH A COMMISSARY WHERE ANYBODY THAT WORKED FOR THEM COULD SIGN ON THE LINE AND GET STUFF AND THEN WHEN THEY SOLD THE PROPS, THEY WOULD PAY THEIR BILLS INTO THE YEAR.</p><p>THE BAD THING WAS AT THE END OF THE YEAR IF YOU COULDN'T PAY YOUR BILLS, YOU WEREN'T GOING ANYWHERE SO THATWAS NOT AS BAD AS SLAVERY BUT IT WAS STILL BAD .</p><p>>> ANYBODY KNOW WHAT THESE ARE?</p><p>WHAT ARE THEY?</p><p>THAT'S WHAT THEY USED TO USE, ISN'T IT?</p><p>WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED, THEY MADE THEM OUT OF GRASS.</p><p>WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS CASH REGISTER, THE MOST EXPENSIVE THING ON IT, YOU CAN RING UP $5.99.</p><p>IS THE MOST YOU CAN RING UP ON IT AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, THE PENNIES WERE ALL WORN OUT.</p><p>SOMEBODY REPLACED THE FIVE BUT THE PENNIES, IT TELLS YOU HOW STUFF STUFF WAS IN THIS WAS THE PART WHEN KIDS WHEN THEY'RE AROUND, WHEN I DO THIS , THEY'VE NEVER DONE THAT.</p><p>THAT'S DOLLARS.</p><p>OKAY, 260.</p><p>THAT HIT THAT REAL HARD.</p><p>OKAY.</p><p>>> THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A CHURCH FROM THE 1920S.</p><p>WE HAD A LOCAL PASTOR WHO SHOWED US HOW THEIR CHURCHES WERE SET UP BACK IN THE DAY AND THAT BENCH ACTUALLY WOULD BE UP ON THE PLATFORM.</p><p>HAS ANYBODY EVER HEARD OF A BROADER SENSE?</p><p>>> HOW OFTEN DO YOU GET TO TRY OUT A CHURCH PUMP ORGAN?</p><p>>> AND AT THE PLANTATION SCHOOL YOU CAN FIND THE ORIGINAL IPAD OR TABLET.</p><p>THE OLD CHALKBOARD SLATE.</p><p>>> I FORGOT TO TELL YOU GUYS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SCHOOL.</p><p>WHEN THE SCHOOL YEAR, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR KIDS, WHEN THEY GOT TO BE 10 OR 11 YEARS OLD, THAT WAS ALL OF THE SCHOOL FOR THEM.</p><p>THEY WENT OUT AND WORKING FIELDS.</p><p>>> BLACKSMITH SHOPS WERE OF COURSE ESSENTIAL ON PLANTATIONS FOR REPAIRING EQUIPMENT AND SHOEING HORSES AND MULES.</p><p>>> HE THERE?</p><p>IT PUTS EXTRA OXYGEN AND YOU HAVE THE WOODEN POLES, THEY GET REALLY HOT.</p><p>THEY GOT HOT ENOUGH TO MAKE A COLD KIT AND THENTHE COOL KIDS , THEN IT GETS REALLY.</p><p>>> THE KEEL BOAT IS A REPRESENTATION OF THE TYPE OF VESSEL THAT BROUGHT THE PLANTATION OWNERS TO THE SCOTT AREA AND WAS ALSO VIEWED IN ANOTHER FAMOUS EXCURSION.</p><p>>> THE LEWIS AND CLARK EXPEDITION, THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE, WE BOUGHT A BUNCH OF LAND AS A COUNTRY THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE BOUGHT.</p><p>IT HAD NEVERBEEN SURVEYED OR ANYTHING SO LEWIS AND CLARKE WERE SURVEYORS AND THEY WENT UP LOOKING AT THE LAND, THEY HAD JOURNALS .</p><p>THEY SURVEY THE PROPERTY.</p><p>AND THEY HAD ONE OF THESE, THIS IS A KEEL BOAT.</p><p>>> SO AFTER THEIR VISIT WE HAD TO ASK THE STUDENTS THIS QUESTION.</p><p>>> YOU THINK YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE LIVED BACK 150, 180 YEARS AGO?</p><p>AND VISITED THIS TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT ?</p><p>NOT TOO APPEALING, HA?</p><p>>> YOU THINK YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED TO LIVE BACK THEN?</p><p>>> I WOULD SAY MAYBE BECAUSE I THINK I WOULD KIND OF LIKE IT BECAUSE THE SCHOOLHOUSES WERE KIND OF AMAZING BUT AS FOR THE PADDLING AND STUFF.</p><p>>> I LEARNED THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T USE STUFF THAT WE USED NOW AND MY FAVORITE THING WAS THE CHAIN.</p><p>>> DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE LIVED THIS LIKE 150 YEARS AGO?</p><p>>> YEAH, NOT SO MUCH.</p><p>I HISTORY LESSON LEARNED FIRSTHAND AND TO BE GRATEFUL FOR LIVING IN THIS DAY AND TIME.</p><p>>>.</p><p>[BELL RINGING] >>.</p><p>[OMINOUS MUSIC] >> FROM A LIFETIME I WENT FISHING FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT FISH BUT NEVER FOR GAR SO WE HOOKED UP WITH OUR GOOD BUDDY SHANE GOODNER WHO'S GOING TO TAKE US TO HIS FAVORITE BAR HOLE.</p><p>I HAVE MY GUARD CAM.</p><p>>> LONGNOSE GAR IS WHAT WE ARE AFTER.</p><p>A COUSIN OF THE LARGER ALLIGATOR GAR.</p><p>>> THAT IS THE GENUS AND SPECIES NAME FOR THE LONGNOSE GAR.</p><p>COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS LEAVE THEM ALONE.</p><p>>> THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS WE ARE GOING TO FISH FOR THESE TODAY BUT GAR BEING AN APEX PREDATOR, THESE ARE LITTLE LONG EARED SUNFISH AND GREEN SUNFISH.</p><p>IT'S ALL PERCH AND THE SUNFISH FAMILY.</p><p>THESE GAR REALLY DO WELL WITH LIVE BAIT.>> WHEN YOU'RE MESSING WITH THESE, I'VE HAD IT ON HERE FOR 20 MINUTES BEFORE.</p><p>THEY'LL JUST RUN WITH IT WITHOUT SWALLOWING IT.</p><p>YOU TAKE ANY FISH OR SPECIES THAT YOU GO AT.</p><p>BUT IT TAKES TIME TO HOOK THESE FISH.</p><p>JUST BECAUSE THEY GRAB THE BAIT AND TAKE OFF.</p><p>IF YOU SET THE HOOK AS SOON AS THE FISH GRABBED THE BAIT NINE TIMES OUT OF 10 YOU WILL LOSE THEM BECAUSE HE'S GRABBING IT AND IT'S IN HIS MOUTH, HE'S GOING TO RUN WITH IT.</p><p>THAT'S ALL GAR WHETHER IT'S TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN OR THE BOTTOM.</p><p>THEY'RE GOING TO RUN WITH IT.</p><p>YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT WITH THE FISH, IF YOU DON'T YOU WILL HAVE ZERO HOOKUPS.</p><p>>> WHICH IS WHY MOST PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH TRYING TO CATCH GAR.</p><p>>> NOW GRAB IT RIGHT THERE.</p><p>SEE HOW HE'S JUST RUNNING WITH IT?</p><p>HE'S NOT ATTEMPTING TO SWALLOW IT?</p><p>THAT'S THE NATURE OF THESE FISH.</p><p>THE BAIT, SECURE IT IN THEIR MOUTH AND THEN THEY RUN WITH IT, THAT'S THEIR NAME.</p><p>>> BUT THIS IS COMMON, WHETHER IT'S IN ALLIGATOR GAR, THEY ALL LIKE THE SAME.</p><p>THEY ALL RUN WITH THE BAIT AND IT'S THEIR VERY NATURE TO RUN WITH THE BAIT BEFORE THEY THE HOOK.</p><p>HE GOBBLED IT RIGHT THERE.</p><p>>> WHAM.</p><p>HOW ABOUT THAT FIRST TRY.</p><p>LOOK AT HIM JUST SITTING THERE WITH HIS TONGUE IN IT.</p><p>>> THAT'S A BIG ONE.</p><p>>> FINALLY AFTER ABOUT 2 AND A HALF HOURS OF PLAYING AROUND.</p><p>>> LOOK AT THAT ONE.</p><p>LOOK AT THAT MAYBE.</p><p>>> YOU GOT TO WATCH IT THERE.</p><p>AND GOT HIM.</p><p>NOW THE NATIVE AMERICANS, THE ABERNATHY TRIBE REFERRED TO THE LONGNOSE GAR AS THE FOUR.</p><p>IT'S THE MEAT OF THIS FISH USES AT THE SCALE.</p><p>AND TOOK THE BEEF AND CAUSED A TATTOO WHICH IS INTERESTING.</p><p>THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT WOULD BE THAT PLEASANT.</p><p>BUT NATIVE AMERICANS WERE BIG ABOUT USING EVERY PIECE OF THE FOOD THAT THEY TASTE.</p><p>IS THAT BAD BOY BACK DOWN INTO THELAKE .</p><p>THERE HAVE BEEN GAR SPECIES FOR 100 MILLION YEARS.</p><p>THAT'S A REAL SURVIVOR RIGHT THERE.</p><p>AND WHILE WERE ON THE SUBJECT I GOT AGGRAVATED WHEN I HEAR GAR REFERRED TO AS A NUISANCE OR A TRASH FISH.</p><p>THERE ARE NO SPECIES ON THIS EARTH THAT NO MORE ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE GOING ON AND MOTHER NATURE.</p><p>THOSE FISH HAVE ANY PURPOSE ON YOUR DATE HAVE BEEN EXTERMINATED YEARS AGO.</p><p>THAT FISH IS BEEN IN THESE WATERS FOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS.</p><p>WHO ARE THEY TO SAY THAT FISH DOESN'T HAVE A PURPOSE ON THIS EARTH?</p><p>I UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT THE EASIEST FISH IN THE WORLD BUT IF YOU'RE A FISHERMAN, APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THAT'S AN APEX PREDATOR IN THE WATER.</p><p>IT DOESN'T EAT ITS WEIGHT ITS MISSION EVERY DAY ANDGO AROUND DAMAGING FISH LIKE SOME OF THE FISH I COULD NAME IN OUR AREA .</p><p>THAT'S ANOTHER SUBJECT.</p><p>THOSE FISH LIVE IN HARMONY WITH EVERYTHING IN THE WATERS.</p><p>JUST SAW A BIG BASS AND A FEW FEET, HE COULD HAVE KILLED HIM ANYTIME HE WANTED TO.</p><p>IT'S A HARMONIOUS RELATIONSHIP, PREDATOR AND PREY.</p><p>EVERYTHING IN THIS RIVER LIVES IN HARMONY.</p><p>THERE A NOBLE FISH.</p><p>YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IN PART TWO OF THESE SHOWS THEY'RE VERY GOOD TO EAT.</p><p>>> AND SO WITH A FEW OF SHANE'S BUDDIES WE HAD US AGAR FRIED.</p><p>>> LET'S GO OVER HERE.</p><p>NICE WHITE TEXTURE, MORE LIKE A NEAT FISH.</p><p>>> ALL RIGHT, TASTING GAR FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.</p><p>LOOKING AT IT IT REMINDS ME OF LIKE A PORK CHOP TEXTURE.</p><p>>>.</p><p>[SHOUTING] >>.</p><p>[MUSIC] SOME OF THE MORE PICTURESQUE CAMPSITES THROUGH THE NATURAL STATE ARE THOSE THAT WERE BUILT BY THE CIVILIAN CONSERVATION CORPS OF ECC BACK DURING THE 1930S AND ONE OF THEM HAPPENS TO BE CLEAR FOR AND EVERY YEAR SOMETHING SPECIAL TAKES PLACE HERE DURING A UNIQUE HANDS-ON YOUTH SUMMER ECOLOGY CAMP.</p><p>>> THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY A BABY OF A VENOMOUS TYPE THAT CAME DOWN BY THE LAKE.</p><p>THIS IS A COTTONMOUTH COTTONMOUTH AND THEY DO SOMETHING CALLED LORING.</p><p>THEY WILL ACTUALLY WITH THEIR TAIL LIKE A WORM AND HERE COMES A LITTLE ONE.</p><p>LOOK AT THAT.</p><p>>> THAT BEGAN IN THE LATE 70S.</p><p>WITH HENRY HALBERG, THE ARKANSAS AUDUBON SOCIETY HALBERG CONSERVATION.</p><p>ALL THE KIDS LEARNED ABOUT SNAKES AND CAMPS.</p><p>>> THIS IS A LARGE SPECIES THAT WE HAVE RIGHT HERE.</p><p>EVERYBODY SEE THE EYES ON THE LAND SNAIL?</p><p>THERE'S TWO EYES ON LONG TENTACLES LIKE THAT.</p><p>>> THAT'S RIGHT.</p><p>>> THESE ARE BEST BEETLES AND THIS IS THE BABY.</p><p>SO WHAT'S REALLY COOL ABOUT THESE GUYS IS THAT THEY WILL RAISE THEIR YOUNG SO LET'S PULL HIM OUT.</p><p>THIS IS THE LARVAL STAGE BUT THIS IS A BABY NEEDLE.</p><p>>> AND THEN THIS IS THE MOM AND DAD.</p><p>SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET THEM TO SQUEAK BUT THESE ARE WONDERFUL GUYS THAT START OFF HOLDING, IF YOU ARE COMFORTABLEWITH HOLDING INSECTS .</p><p>>> THEY WON'T BITE YOU OR ANYTHING.</p><p>>> NO.</p><p>>> THE BITING QUESTION IS ASKED OFTEN.</p><p>>> I COULD BUT YOU TWO.</p><p>>> THEN YOU WOULD BE A CANNIBAL.</p><p>>> WE NOT ONLY TRY TO OPEN THEIR EYES TO THE NATURAL WORLD AROUND THEM, WE TRY TO HAVE MORE OF THESE CITY KIDS THAT DON'T GET TO EXPERIENCE CANOEING SO WE TRIED TO OPEN THEIR EYES TO THAT AND GET THEM IN THE WATER A LITTLE BIT SO WE GET THEM INTO THE OUTDOORS A LITTLE BIT SO HOPEFULLY THEY GO ON LIKE MOM, DAD, I TRIED THIS NEW THING.</p><p>UNLIKE WITH US AND GIVE THEM THE EXPERIENCE IN THE OUTDOORS.</p><p>>> I'VE HAD GREAT FUN HERE, I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH HERE.</p><p>I'VELEARNED ABOUT AQUATIC BIOLOGY, BOTANY AND ALL TYPES OF OTHER STUFF .</p><p>I'VE LEARNED THAT THERE'S LIFE ALL AROUND US EVEN WHEN WE CAN'T SEE IT AND IN AQUATIC BIOLOGY WE GOT TO WATCH SOMETHING FROM THE LAKE AND LOOK AT OUR MICROSCOPES AND THERE WAS ALL TYPES OF MICROSCOPIC ORGANISMS LIVING AROUND US AND IN OUR BODIES.</p><p>>> I LEARNED SOME NEW BIRDS, I LEARNED THE NAMES OF NEW BIRDS THAT I NEVER KNEW BEFORE AND I WAS JUST INTERESTED IN THE FACT THAT A HAWK CAN LIVE UP TO 28 YEARS, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.</p><p>THEY CAN LIVE UP TO 16 OR 17 YEARS AND I ALSO LEARNED ABOUT SOME BUGS AND SOME SNAKES AND STUFF.</p><p>>> HOW DO YOU LIKE THOSE SNAKES?</p><p>>> I MEAN, THE ONLY THING I'M AFRAID ABOUT IS IF THEY BITE ME OR SOMETHING BUT THEY'RE PRETTY COOL LOOKING.</p><p>>> I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT BEING A SCIENTIST, I DON'T BELIEVE IN MAGIC BUT I BELIEVE THIS CAMP IS MAGICAL.</p><p>YOU GET THE RIGHT MIX OF INSTRUCTORS AND THE RIGHT MIX OF PEOPLE THAT COOK THE FOOD AND THE SETTING AND THE RIGHT ATTITUDE, THEY'LL COME AWAY CHANGED.</p><p>FOREVER.</p><p>NO DOUBT.</p><p>AND I'VE SEEN YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ONLY COME HERE ONE YEAR AND I RUN INTO THEM LATER AND THEY'RE DOING JOB IN NATURE.</p><p>THEY ARE PART INTERPRETER, GOING OFF TO ANOTHER COUNTRY STUDYING INSECTS,STUDYING OWLS .</p><p>SO WE DEFINITELYHAVE AN IMPACT .</p><p>>>.</p><p>[MUSIC] SINCE
