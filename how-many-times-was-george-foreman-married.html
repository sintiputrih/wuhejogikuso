Each of his marriages has its own unique story, from the duration of the marriage to significant events and controversies.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>First Marriage: Adrienne Calhoun (1971-1974)</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Foreman's first marriage was to Adrienne Calhoun, whom he married in December 1971. Unfortunately, infidelity became an issue for the couple, as Foreman had an affair with a woman named Pamela Clay, who is the mother of Foreman's eldest son, George Foreman Jr. The marriage ended in February 1974. Adrienne and George share one child, a daughter named Michi.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Second Marriage: Cynthia Lewis (1977-1979)</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>In 1977, Foreman married former Miss Black Teenage America Cynthia Lewis. Their marriage was tumultuous, with Lewis alleging both physical and mental abuse by Foreman. She claimed she wasn’t allowed to watch TV or wear short sleeves, pants, or jewelry. The couple divorced around 1979.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Third Marriage: Sharon Goodson (1981-1982)</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Foreman's third marriage was to Sharon Goodson, which lasted less than a year, from 1981 to 1982.
