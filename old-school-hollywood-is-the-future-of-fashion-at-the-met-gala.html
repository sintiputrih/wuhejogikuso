For Scottish aristocrat Leslie, accompanied by husband and Games of Thrones co-star Kit Harrington, finding her look was a two-step process. “We were wanting to go for art deco but with a modern concept, but we wanted to end with old Hollywood glamour,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_84%2C$y_69/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/5815646e866ddc97845a451da7b73febf216968a><p>For supermodel and reality star Kendall Jenner, American glamour was a recreation of Audrey Hepburn’s My Fair Lady look through the filter of Las Vegas by Givenchy. In a surprise twist Jenner’s sister Kim Kardashian, usually an ambassador of nude illusion dresses, staged a hopefully ironic Greta Garbo “I want to be alone” moment, arriving fully masked in black Balenciaga couture.</p><p>Joining Kardashian with the stunt approach were those seeking to achieve the same legendary meme status as Rihanna’s 2015 Met Gala dress by Guo Pei. Singer Frank Ocean inexplicably nursed a robot doll, veteran model Iman dressed like two crop circles in a sea of gold, while singer Grimes in Iris van Herpen carried a sword made from melted firearms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.516%2C$multiply_0.4233%2C$ratio_0.666667%2C$width_378%2C$x_3%2C$y_32/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/d3f82d8e71241dc1b865eb52e97f374a254d2348><p>The most obvious statement of the night belonged to politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, wearing a white tuxedo-inspired dress by Aurora James with the statement “Tax the rich”, before taking her seat at the $US35,000 ($47,597) a ticket event.</p><p>Ocasio-Cortez was prepared for the future cries of hypocrisy. “We can’t just play along,” she said. “While The Met is known for its spectacle, we should have a conversation about it.”</p><p>Soft politics was also present by the number of openly LGBTQIA+ guests. Australian singer Troye Sivan paired a black singlet dress with a Cartier necklace, supermodel Cara Delevingne’s white bib invited readers to “Peg the patriarchy”, Schitt’s Creek creator Dan Levy wore a lurid Loewe tribute to marriage equality while Dear Evan Hansen singer Ben Platt was a rhinestone cowboy in Christian Cowan.</p><p>“America equals gay,” Platt said. The arrival of flamboyant rapper Lil Nas X added weight to this view, in a series of three Versace looks that transitioned from a royal cape, to glistening armour before ending with a bedazzled bodysuit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.252%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/a7c09fbff012fa47d93f615612d70f75c731169b><p>Before any right-wing protesters were roused, Jennifer Lopez arrived in predictably revealing Ralph Lauren with a cowboy hat and Ben Affleck.</p><p>Hollywood glamour restored once again.
