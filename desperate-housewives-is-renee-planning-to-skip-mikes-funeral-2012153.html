The whole neighborhood is going.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=397 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Desperate Houswives" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>That’s precisely why Renee doesn’t feel comfortable attending her friend’s funeral. “They’ll all be thinking, ‘There’s the woman that Mike was protecting when he beat up the loan shark. She’s the reason he’s dead.’ Mike stuck his neck out for me, and now Susan’s a widow,” Renee tells Bree. “A 9-year-old kid has to grow up without a father.”</p><p>Though sympathetic towards Renee, Bree knows how important it is for Susan to have close friends by her side. “I know you feel awful about what happened, but today is about honoring Mike,” she reminds Renee. “You do not get to make this about your guilt.”</p><p>Renee eventually agrees to attend Mike’s funeral and walks home to change into more appropriate clothes. Moments later, a police officer approaches Bree outside her home. “If this is about Mike Delfino’s murder, I’d be happy to help,” Bree tells him, “but as you can see I’m on my way to his funeral.”</p><p>“Actually, we already made an arrest in that case. I’m here on an unrelated matter,” the police officer says. “It’s a missing persons investigation. I’d like you to come down and answer some questions.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Have the cops discovered that Bree and her friends conspired to cover up the accidental murder of Gabrielle Solis’ stepfather Alejandro Perez (<strong>Tony Plana</strong>)?
