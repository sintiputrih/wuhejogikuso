Like all the great TV legends, after 19 years of seeing him in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">popular CBS procedural drama</a>, it’s nearly impossible to look at him and not see Agent Leroy Gibbs.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=511 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>Since its debut in 2003,&nbsp;NCIS&nbsp;has become one of the longest-running scripted American primetime television shows, behind only&nbsp;Law & Order: Special Victims Unit&nbsp;and&nbsp;Law & Order. Despite never winning an Emmy Award, the military police procedural’s popularity can be evidenced by the number of spin-offs it inspired. To date, the franchise includes four spin-offs:&nbsp;NCIS: Los Angeles&nbsp;(2009-2023),&nbsp;NCIS: New Orleans&nbsp;(2014-2021),&nbsp;NCIS: Hawaiʻi&nbsp;(2021-present), and&nbsp;NCIS: Sydney&nbsp;(2023-present).</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>Harmon’s tenure on the flagship&nbsp;NCIS&nbsp;ended in season 19’s fourth episode, “Great Wide Open.” Gibbs, no longer weighed down by the warrant for his arrest, decides to live out the remainder of his days miles away from civilization in Alaska. For the first time since losing his family, he’s found peace and isn’t willing to give it up.</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true>After 18 years, countless missions, and more deaths than we can keep track of, Gibbs (and Harmon) hung up his badge and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said goodbye to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-total-number-of-episodes-mark-harmon-appeared-as-agent-gibbs-in-ncis data-injectable=false>The total number of episodes Mark Harmon appeared as Agent Gibbs in NCIS</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true>Going off of&nbsp;NCIS&nbsp;alone, Mark Harmon appeared as Agent Gibbs in 435 episodes across 19 seasons. Of course, if you factor in the appearances he made across the entire&nbsp;NCIS&nbsp;franchise — and even an episode of&nbsp;Family Guy&nbsp;— then that number is a tad higher.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>In 2003, Harmon played Gibbs in two episodes of JAG season 8. If you didn’t know, NCIS is actually a spin-off of JAG, and Harmon first breathed life into the character there in episodes 20 and 21, titled “Ice Queen” and “Meltdown,” respectively.</p><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true>Harmon also played Gibbs in four episodes of NCIS: New Orleans across four seasons. The first was in 2014 in season 1, episode 3, “Breaking Brig.” The next was in season 2, episode 12, titled “Sister City: Part II.” The third was in season 3, episode 14, titled “Pandora’s Box, Part II.” The fourth and final time was in the season 5 premiere “See You Soon” in 2018.</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>Finally, Harmon voiced Agent Gibbs in season 10, episode 13 of Family Guy, “Tom Tucker: The Man and His Dream.” That would bring Harmon’s total number of appearances as Gibbs to 441, but counting Family Guy feels a bit like a stretch, so let’s just round it down to a nice 440.</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=706 data-injectable=true>Even though Harmon said goodbye to Agent Gibbs in season 19, he still remains an integral part of the show as an executive producer. In speaking with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> magazine in 2023, executive producer Steve Binder cautioned viewers from counting Agent Gibbs out for good, saying, “So regarding the future of Gibbs, as long-time fans of the show may have noticed over the years… never count Leroy Jethro Gibbs out.”</p><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=124 data-injectable=false>The day may come when Harmon could play Agent Gibbs one more time. If or when that does, we’ll update this list posthaste.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMppinsV2avaq%2Fzp2crGWfm3qvr8isZJ2hlGK6or7KZp%2Baqp2ku7R5xqKZm6tdlr2xscCrZKKmXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
