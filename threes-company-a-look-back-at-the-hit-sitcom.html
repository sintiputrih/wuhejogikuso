[The producers] painted me as greedy. ... So the whole show — cast and crew — shunned me. ... So, I never talked to anybody on that show ever again. Ever again."</p><p dir=ltr>It was a silence that lasted for years after Somers' 1981 departure from the show, but amends were eventually made. <a href=#>People</a> says that in 1996, John Ritter got word that Somers was being treated for breast cancer. "[It] made me realize that all I care about is how happy and healthy she lives her life," Ritter said — so he called her. Somers recalled the conversation, saying, "He said, 'I miss you. I love you. I'm sorry,'" adding that she&nbsp;"said the same things."</p><p>Somers and DeWitt reunited on Somers' show, <a href=#>"Breaking Through,"</a> in 2012. <a href=#>TV Guide</a> says that it was the first time they'd gotten together since the end of "Three's Company," and it was tear-jerking stuff. Apologies were said, and admissions were made: Somers admitted she had been overwhelmed and felt surrounded by serious actors, and was afraid that she wasn't worthy of being in the show. DeWitt spoke candidly about her fear of fame and discomfort with the others, and in the end, they hugged, found middle ground, and were grateful to reconnect.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kG9ua3BjZMGpvsSeqmabn6K9orrYZphmpJ%2BkuG6uwJyiZpmkYsGpsYyhoK1lo57BpLvMaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
