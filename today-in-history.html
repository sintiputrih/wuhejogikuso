Berry had parachuted from hot air balloons before, but his leap from an airplane was the first of its kind in aviation history.</p><h2>1932: The Lindbergh Baby Is Kidnapped</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-403023 alt="Charles Lindbergh Jr" width=900 height=720 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/charles-lindbergh-jr.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-403023 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>FBI</span><span class=caption-body>Young Charles Lindbergh, Jr., shortly before his kidnapping and murder.</span></p><p>Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr., the 20-month-old son of Charles Lindbergh, the famous pilot, is <a href=# rel=noopener>kidnapped</a> from his home in Hopewell, New Jersey. The baby’s nurse noticed that he was missing from his nursery around 10 p.m., and the family found a ransom note for $50,000 in the window. After two months of negotiations and increasing demands, the child’s body was found less than five miles away from the Lindbergh home. A German carpenter named Bruno Richard Hauptmann was eventually convicted of the murder.</p><h2>1971: Weather Underground Bombs The U.S. Capitol Building</h2><p>Weather Underground, a radical far-left organization, bombs the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C. The explosion caused $300,000 in damage, but there were no casualties. The group claimed they carried out the bombing in protest of the invasion of Laos, which the U.S. government was backing. Weather Underground also bombed 24 other locations over the course of seven years, including the Pentagon, to protest American imperialism.</p><h2>2008: Charlie Wilkinson Murders The Caffey Family</h2><p>Charlie Wilkinson, the boyfriend of 16-year-old <a href=# rel=noopener>Erin Caffey</a>, breaks into her home in Emory, Texas armed with a gun and a sword and kills her mother and two brothers, then burns her house to the ground. Wilkinson’s friend, Charles Waid, assists with the deadly attack. It was later revealed that Caffey had helped Wilkinson plan the murders because she was angry with her religious parents for ordering her to break up with him. Erin Caffey’s father, Terry, ended up surviving the rampage. Both Wilkinson and Caffey were sentenced to life in prison, though Caffey will eventually be eligible for parole.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1u8OasGahnmK1qr%2FTqKmyZ52Wv6S0jGo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
