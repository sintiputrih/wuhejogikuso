In addition, 7200 RPM Red Pro models with 2 - 4 TB capacities were also introduced. We have already <a href=#>looked</a> at the performance of the WD Red, and it now time for us to take the WD Red Pro for a spin. In our <a href=#>4 TB NAS drive roundup</a> from last year, we also indicated that efforts would be taken to add more drives to the mix along with an updated benchmarking scheme involving RAID-5 volumes. The Red Pro gives us an opportunity to present results from the evaluation of various drives that have arrived in our labs since then.</p><p>The SMB / SOHO / consumer NAS market has been experiencing rapid growth over the last few years. With declining PC sales and increase in affordability of SSDs, hard drive vendors have scrambled to make up for the deficit and increase revenue by targeting the NAS market. The good news is that the growth is expected to accelerate in the near future (thanks to increasing amounts of user-generated data through the usage of mobile devices). In addition, security threats such as <a href=#>SynoLocker </a>have also underscored the necessity of frequent backups.</p><p>Back in <a href=#>July 2012</a>, Western Digital began the trend of hard drive manufacturers bringing out dedicated units for the burgeoning SOHO / consumer NAS market with the 3.5" Red hard drive lineup. The firmware was tuned for 24x7 operation in SOHO and consumer NAS units. 1 TB, 2 TB and 3 TB versions were made available at launch. Later, Seagate also <a href=#>jumped into the fray</a> with a hard drive series carrying similar firmware features. Over the last two years, the vendors have been optimizing the firmware features as well as increasing the capacities. On the enterprise side, hard drive vendors have been supplying different models for different applications, but all of them are quite suitable for 24x7 NAS usage. While mission-critical applications tend to use SAS drives, it is the <a href=#>nearline</a> SATA versions that are more suitable for home / SMB users. These enterprise drives provide better reliability / longer warranties compared to the NAS-specific WD Red and the Seagate NAS HDD lineups.</p><p>The correct choice of hard drives for a NAS system is influenced by a number of factors. These include expected workloads, performance requirements and power consumption restrictions, amongst others. In this review, we will discuss some of these aspects while evaluating ten different hard drives targeting the NAS market. One of the most glaring omissions in our list is HGST's Deskstar NAS. Due to HGST's strange sampling scheme, we are still trying to obtain enough drives for our NAS-specific benchmkaring, but they did send us their 4 TB SAS drive for participation in this roundup. Other than the HGST SAS drive, the other nine drives all carry a SATA interface.</p><li>WD Red Pro (WD4001FFSX-68JNUN0)</li><li>Seagate Enterprise Capacity 3.5" HDD v4 (ST4000NM0024-1HT178)</li><li>WD Red (WD40EFRX-68WT0N0)</li><li>Seagate NAS HDD (ST4000VN000-1H4168)</li><li>WD Se (WD4000F9YZ-09N20L0)</li><li>Seagate Terascale (ST4000NC000-1FR168)</li><li>WD Re (WD4000FYYZ-01UL1B0)</li><li>Seagate Constellation ES.3 (ST4000NM0033-9ZM170)</li><li>Toshiba MG03ACA400</li><li>HGST Ultrastar 7K4000 SAS (HUS724040ALS640)</li><p>The above drives do not target the same specific market. For example, the WD Red and Seagate NAS HDD are for 1- 8 bay NAS systems in the tower form factor. The WD Red Pro is meant for rackmount units up to 16 bays, but is not intended to be a replacement for drives such as the WD Re, Seagate Constellation ES.3, Seagate Enterprise Capacity v4 and the Toshiba MG03ACA400 which target enterprise applications requiring durability under heavy workloads. The WD Se and the Seagate Terascale target the capacity-sensitive cold storage / data center market.</p><h3>Testbed Setup and Testing Methodology</h3><p>Unlike our <a href=#>previous evaluation</a> of 4 TB drives, we managed to obtain enough samples of the new drives to test them in a proper NAS environment. As usual, we will start off with a feature set comparison of the various drives, followed by a look at the raw performance when connected directly to a SATA 6 Gbps port. In the same PC, we also evaluate the performance of the drive using <a href=#>some aspects of our direct attached storage (DAS) testing methodology</a>. For evaluation in a NAS environment, we configured three drives of each model in a RAID-5 volume and processed selected benchmarks from our standard NAS review methodology. Since our NAS drive testbed supports both SATA and SAS drives, but our DAS testbed doesn't, the HGST SAS drive was not subject to any of the DAS benchmarks. We plan to carry more detailed coverage of the HGST SAS unit in a future SAS-specific roundup.</p><p>We used two testbeds in our evaluation, one for benchmarking the raw drive and DAS performance and the other for evaluating performance when placed in a NAS unit.</p><table align=center border=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=600><tbody readability=5><tr readability=2><td class=contentwhite colspan=2>AnandTech DAS Testbed Configuration</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Motherboard</td><td>Asus Z97-PRO Wi-Fi ac ATX</td></tr><tr><td>CPU</td><td>Intel Core i7-4790</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Memory</td><td>Corsair Vengeance Pro CMY32GX3M4A2133C11<br>32 GB (4x 8GB)<br>DDR3-2133 @ 11-11-11-27</td></tr><tr><td>OS Drive</td><td>Seagate 600 Pro 400 GB</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Optical Drive</td><td>Asus BW-16D1HT 16x Blu-ray Write (w/ M-Disc Support)</td></tr><tr><td>Add-on Card</td><td>Asus Thunderbolt EX II</td></tr><tr><td>Chassis</td><td>Corsair Air 540</td></tr><tr><td>PSU</td><td>Corsair AX760i 760 W</td></tr><tr><td>OS</td><td>Windows 8.1 Pro</td></tr><tr readability=2><td colspan=2><strong>Thanks to Asus and Corsair for the build components</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the above testbed, the hot swap bays of the Corsair Air 540 have to be singled out for special mention.<br>They were quite helpful in getting the drives processed in a fast and efficient manner for benchmarking. For NAS evaluation, we used the <a href=#>QNAP TS-EC1279U-SAS-RP</a>. This is very similar to the unit we <a href=#>reviewed</a> last year, except that we have a slightly faster CPU, more RAM and support for both SATA and SAS drives.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/8263/qnap_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The NAS setup itself was subjected to benchmarking using our standard NAS testbed.</p><table align=center border=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=600><tbody readability=11><tr readability=2><td class=contentwhite colspan=2>AnandTech NAS Testbed Configuration</td></tr><tr></tr><tr readability=2><td>Motherboard</td><td>Asus Z9PE-D8 WS Dual LGA2011 SSI-EEB</td></tr><tr><td>CPU</td><td>2 x Intel Xeon E5-2630L</td></tr><tr><td>Coolers</td><td>2 x Dynatron R17</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Memory</td><td>G.Skill RipjawsZ F3-12800CL10Q2-64GBZL (8x8GB) CAS 10-10-10-30</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>OS Drive</td><td>OCZ Technology Vertex 4 128GB</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Secondary Drive</td><td>OCZ Technology Vertex 4 128GB</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Tertiary Drive</td><td>OCZ Z-Drive R4 CM88 (1.6TB PCIe SSD)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Other Drives</td><td>12 x OCZ Technology Vertex 4 64GB (Offline in the Host OS)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Network Cards</td><td>6 x Intel ESA I-340 Quad-GbE Port Network Adapter</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Chassis</td><td>SilverStoneTek Raven RV03</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>PSU</td><td>SilverStoneTek Strider Plus Gold Evolution 850W</td></tr><tr><td>OS</td><td>Windows Server 2008 R2</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Network Switch</td><td>Netgear ProSafe GSM7352S-200</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Thank You!</strong></p><p>We thank the following companies for helping us out with our NAS testbed:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIVzgpRorp1lopqxbrzRqGSrnaaesrh5k2arm2WUp7a3sdJmnaiqXaOutHnSsqqtnZ2oeqOxzZyfppmioLKl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
