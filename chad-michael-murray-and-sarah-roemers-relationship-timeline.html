I’m a family guy. I want that core,” the <a href=#>One Tree Hill alum</a> told E! News in January 2015, shortly after revealing that he had <a href=#>secretly wed Roemer</a>. “I tend to keep everything quiet. I love my life. That’s the part I keep for myself.”</p><p>After the incognito nuptials, Murray’s rep told Us Weekly that the pair were “extremely happy and excited and enjoying their life together.” The two actors welcomed their son in May 2015.</p><p>“We’ve been blessed with a son. God’s greatest gift,” the <a href=#>Cinderella Story</a> actor wrote via Twitter at the time. “Sarah and I couldn’t be happier.” The duo continued to grow their family, welcoming a daughter in March 2017.</p><p>The doting dad and Roemer have not publicly disclosed their children’s names. They also don’t show the little ones’ faces on social media, but that doesn’t stop them from <a href=#>sharing glimpses of family life</a>. “The snuggles are real. No better duty than #daddyduty,” the House of Wax actor captioned a March 2021 Instagram photo of his daughter sitting on his lap with her arms around his neck. Their third child, another little girl, <a href=#>was born in August 2023</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Murray was previously married to his former One Tree Hill costar <a href=#><strong>Sophia Bush</strong></a> from 2005 to 2006.
