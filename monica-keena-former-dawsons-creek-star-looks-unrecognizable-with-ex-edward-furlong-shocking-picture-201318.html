With a restraining order barring troubled Terminator 2 star <strong>Edward Furlong</strong> from seeing his ex girlfriend, former Dawson’s Creek star <strong>Monica Keena</strong>, the two were spotted dining together at El Torito’s Mexican restaurant in Sherman Oaks, Calif.&nbsp;</p><p>When Furlong, 35, spotted the photographer watching them, he reportedly ran away. A few minutes later, an unrecognizable and disheveled Keena, 34, wearing ripped jeans and a loose shirt, was seen picking him up around the corner. Their reunion will likely breach his probation, as Keena has a restraining order again him stemming from their past troubles.&nbsp;</p><p>The Brooklyn native actress played Abby Morgan on Dawson’s Creek from March 1998 to May 1999 (her character drowned after <a href=#><strong>Michelle William</strong></a>‘s character, Jen Lindley, couldn’t save her when Abby fell into the water drunk.)

(In January 2013, he was also met with a domestic violence battery charge, via TMZ. It was <a href=#>reportedly</a> his third domestic violence charge in the span of three months).</p><p>On July 1, the former child actor <a href=#>looked unrecognizable</a> in court, where he plead no contest on the domestic violence charges stemming from the May charges. According to TMZ, he managed to evade jail time altogether and received 61 days’ worth of jail time credit.
