This confirms that non-metal oxides are acidic in nature. Example-Sodium hydroxide gives sodium carbonate and water when it reacts with carbon dioxide.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-bases-corrosive-to-metals></span>Are bases corrosive to metals?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Common bases, such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, can also <b>attack some metals</b> like aluminum, zinc, galvanized metal, and tin to produce hydrogen gas. The MSDS for a particular corrosive should explain which metals or other materials, such as plastics or wood, it will attack.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happens-when-base-reacts-with-metal-carbonate></span>What happens when base reacts with metal carbonate?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Answer: Bases don’t react with metal carbonates because metal carbonates have basic nature, so <b>there is no reaction occurred when</b> they are reacted with bases. Explanation: Metal carbonates are usually referred to as bases.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happens-when-a-base-reacts-with-a-non-metallic-oxide-write-reaction-what-would-you-infer-about-the-nature-of-the-non-metallic-oxide></span>What happens when a base reacts with a non metallic oxide write reaction what would you infer about the nature of the non metallic oxide?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Non-metal oxides <b>are acidic in nature</b>.

Reaction of nonmetal oxide with salt: SO2 + Na2CO3 → Na2SO3 + CO2.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-non-metals-also-undergo-displacement-reaction-support-your-answer-with-an-example></span>Do non-metals also undergo displacement reaction Support your answer with an example?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Not only metals but also non-metals can take part in displacement reactions depending upon their <b>order of reactivity</b>. For example chlorine can displace bromine from the non-metal salt solution like metal because it is more reactive than bromine.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-a-metal-salt-reacts-with-bases-explain></span>How a metal salt reacts with bases explain?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>CBSE NCERT Notes Class 10 Chemistry Acids Bases Salts. Metals react with base to <b>give metal salt and hydrogen gas</b>. Metal like zinc reacts with sodium hydroxide to produce hydrogen gas.
