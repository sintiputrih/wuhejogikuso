At that time there was a re-emergence of Christian values and lifestyles for many young people. Virginity until marriage was one value pounded into many “good” girls and boys. This song seems to be about the tension between a young woman’s sexuality and her waiting to find her supposedly perfect partner, also the tension between what the body needs and wants and the ideals of the heart and soul.</p><p>Sister Christian</p><p>This name is sort of like “Mr. Businessman” or “General Solider Boy”</p><p>Oh the time has come<br>And you know that you're the only one<br>To say O.K.</p><p>She has graduated from a Catholic girl’s school, she is the only one to say okay to a commitment of virginity until marriage.</p><p>Where you going<br>What you looking for?</p><p>The song is challenging the reasons she has made this commitment</p><p>You know those boys<br>Don't want to play no more with you<br>It's true</p><p>The boys don’t want to (just) play (innocently) anymore (they expect sex) OR The boys don’t like her anymore because she seems cold and aloof.</p><p>Babe you know<br>You're growing up so fast<br>And mama's worrying<br>That you won't last<br>To say let's play</p><p>Her mother is worried about her stress and loneliness. Can she hold out until “okay let’s play”, which means “okay, now we are married, let’s have sex!”</p><p>Sister Christian<br>There's so much in life, Don't you give it up<br>Before your time is due<br>It's true<br>It's true yeah</p><p>Don’t give up your virginity until it is time OR don’t give up on life before it is your time to die.</p><p>Motoring</p><p>Driving around all night, alone, searching for love</p><p>What's your price for flight?</p><p>How much are you willing to pay to live this ideal? Maybe refers to getting into heaven and getting wings?</p><p>You've got him in your sight<br>And driving thru the night<br>Motoring<br>What's your price for flight<br>In finding mister right</p><p>Finally she thinks she has found “Mr. Right”, and is going after him</p><p>You'll be alright tonight</p><p>She tells herself things will all fall into place now OR the writer of the song is telling us she indeed will be happy.<br>(Ironically, in the video the girl ends up rejecting her commitment and jumps into a car full of boys who happen to be the band)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZqehl53Bbr7Ap56eql%2BotrTAxKtknKCinsC1tcCn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
