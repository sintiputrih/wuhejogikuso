The public eats up celebrity feuds like candy, reveling in the pure and simple drama of a high-profile quarrel.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=600 data-current-count=808 data-injectable=true>The latest celebrity beef to catch the internet’s attention is still going strong, as conversations continue to swirl about former wrestlers-turned-actors <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Dave Bautista</strong></a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Dwayne Johnson</strong></a>. The pair of beefy actors share plenty in common, but Johnson’s recent string of misfortune—largely spurred by the failure of Black Adam to meet expectations—is upping the ante. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bautista’s assertion</a> that he “never wanted to be the next Rock,” instead aiming to simply “be a good f***ing actor” piqued audience attention, as they braced themselves for a squabble that seems a long time coming.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>Johnson has yet to truly address Bautista’s comments, but that isn’t stopping the internet from reveling in a mounting—but largely imaginary—beef between the two stars. Bautista doesn’t boast a resume nearly so impressive as Johnson’s, but his success in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as well as recent releases like Glass Onion, are boosting the actor’s brand immensely.</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=822 data-injectable=true>As it stands, it seems that Bautista’s star is rising just as Johnson’s begins to fall. This, paired with Bautista’s comments and Johnson’s misfortune, is prompting drama hounds to examine every aspect of the pair’s relationship. We’ve already looked into who had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">more wins in the ring</a> and who might win in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">real-life fight between the two</a>, but now we’re examining something far more mundane: the actor’s heights.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-is-dwayne-johnson-taller-than-dave-bautista data-injectable=false>Is Dwayne Johnson taller than Dave Bautista?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bautista_Johnson_height.jpg><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=715 data-injectable=true>Johnson and Bautista’s heights are well recorded, thanks to their time in the ring, but the web tends to exaggerate these things. Conflicting reports claim Johnson is anywhere between 6’3 and 6’6, but the wrestler turned actor was kind enough to clarify his height back in 2020. In a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a> to his Instagram page, Johnson explained that he stands at a comfortable—but still impressive—6 foot 4 inches.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=552 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>Bautista, meanwhile, stands just a touch taller, at 6 foot 6 inches. The Guardians of the Galaxy actor’s height is well documented, thanks to his days in the WWE, but these claims are often exaggerated. Bautista himself seems to disagree with assessments that he stands a full two inches taller than Johnson, at least according to an old, 2012 interview with the Glass Onion actor. He confessed, in the interview, that he actually stands at right around the same height as the Rock. He told interviewer Percy Crawford that he is actually 6’4.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=106 data-injectable=false>This means, despite what the public might think, Johnson and Bautista are, in fact, the exact same height.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbvSZquapJyav26w1pqwp51dn7yputKopWanomKxosLEZpmaraSewLWtjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
