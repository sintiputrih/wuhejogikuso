Most of us who knew him would use the adjective ‚Äúmagnificent‚Äù to describe him.</p><p>He spent his formative years in California‚Äôs San Fernando Valley, where he developed his prodigious intelligence and restless energy while also developing a healthy distrust of authority and a deep fascination with the mystical arts.</p><p><strong>You can also take a look at other celebrities who have passed recently, their obituaries details are covered below:</strong></p><p>Kevin‚Äôs brilliance and enjoyment of capturing and holding the attention of his audience were clear even in his early years. Pranks and magic tricks gave way to phone phreaking, social engineering, and computer hacking as his interests matured.</p><p>His need to test limits eventually got the better of him, and he spent time in both juvenile detention and adult prison. His time as the world‚Äôs most wanted hacker was chronicled in the New York Times best-selling book The Ghost in the Wires, as well as the books The Art of Deception and The Art of Intrusion, both co-authored with William Simon, and The Art of Invisibility, co-authored with Robert Vamosi.</p><p>To know more details about the obituaries and passing details of the recent trending people you can join us on our <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter account</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdgbHxzfI6knK%2BhnmK6qsDNopqkZZ%2BXtrXBwKuwaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
