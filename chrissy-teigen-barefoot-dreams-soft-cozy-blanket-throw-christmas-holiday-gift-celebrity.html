We receive compensation when you click on a link and make a purchase. <a href=# rel>Learn more!</a></p><p>We may all have different tastes when it comes to clothing, cosmetics, jewelry, accessories, candles, food…almost everything, but there’s one thing we can all agree on: There’s nothing like a warm, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cozy blanket</a> in the wintertime (or any season, for that matter). We know that a blanket isn’t necessarily an out-of-the-box <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> idea, but we’re not just talking about any blanket here.</p><p>If the name Barefoot Dreams doesn’t ring any bells for you, know that from here on out, those three syllables are going to send your heart and senses soaring. Barefoot Dreams is the authority on all things lounge, creating every last piece we need for a lazy, cozy day spent entirely on our couch. The brand’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">blankets</a> are an absolute home essential — just ask <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Chrissy Teigen</strong></a>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/chrissy-teigen-barefoot-dreams-blanket.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Throw</a> at Nordstrom! See all Barefoot Dreams blankets <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>!</strong></p><p>This is a luxury blanket if we’ve ever seen one. A little while back, Teigen passed out some gifting advice on her Twitter, and we were so excited when she mentioned <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Barefoot Dreams blankets</a>, saying that “if you are struggling for a Christmas gift for someone,” this is her recommendation. She said she uses it “365” and that “nothing else compares” to the feeling of having it wrapped around her body. She even specified afterwards that she wasn’t being paid to promote the brand — she just genuinely loves her Barefoot Dreams blanket that much!</p><p>Teigen isn’t the only one in love. These fuzzy microfiber throws have so many fans, with shoppers agreeing that the style is “the softest blanket ever.” One declared theirs an “emotional support blanket,” saying they “always feel cozy and happy” when it’s draped around them. Another said they “can’t sleep without it,” while many agreed that “every house needs at least one of these.” The words “at least” are key here, because multiple shoppers also reported that “everyone in [their] house is fighting for it”!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Throw</a> for just $147! See all Barefoot Dreams blankets <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>!</strong></p><p>Reviewers also agreed that this blanket makes a perfect gift, whether for the holidays, a housewarming party, a birthday, an anniversary or any other gifting occasion. It can not only complement, but upgrade any living room or bedroom — or any other room in the house — since you’ll be walking around with it draped over your shoulders. Where you go, this <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CozyChic Throw</a> goes!</p><p>This easy-care blanket, which can be machine washed and tumbled dry, is currently available in multiple colors. Each shade is as pretty to the eye as it is soft on the skin, which means we’re probably going to end up wanting one of each. Definitely understandable. Just remember to gift one too!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Throw</a> for just on sale at Nordstrom!
