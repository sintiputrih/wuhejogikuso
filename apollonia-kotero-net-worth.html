Apollonia is a talent manager, singer, actress, and former model, probably best known for her part in the film “Purple Rain” alongside Prince. She was also the lead singer of the girl group Apollonia 6, but all of her endeavors have helped put her net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Apollonia Kotero? As of early-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $4 million, earned through success in her several endeavors. She’s appeared in several films and also handles a multi-media entertainment company. As she continues her career it is expected that her wealth will also increase.</p><h3>Apollonia Kotero Net Worth $4 million</h3><p>Kotero dropped out of high school at 16 to work as a model, and also tried her hand at other opportunities including singing and acting. She entered and won the Miss San Pedro beauty competition, and in the early 1980s became a cheerleader for the Los Angeles Rams. She then found more acting opportunities in television series and films; some of her projects during this period included “Tales of the Gold Monkey” a TV show that was based on the success of the film “Raiders of the Lost Ark”. She was also part of “Fantasy Island” and “Knight Rider”, which is a series starring <a href=#>David Hasselhoff</a>. Aside from these projects, she appeared in several music videos including “The Other Woman” by <a href=#>Ray Parker Jr</a>. and “Shakin” by Eddie Monkey. She was also part of the TV movie entitled “The Mystic Warrior” playing a Native American woman.</p><p>Apollonia then got the opportunity to become part of the 1984 film “Purple Rain” when the original female lead Denise “Vanity” Matthews resigned from girl group Vanity 6. The group was then renamed to Apollonia 6 for the film, and featured&nbsp;Susan Moonsie as well as Brenda Bennett. The film is a musical that was Prince’s acting debut, and would later win an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. The group would go on a worldwide tour to promote their hit single “Sex Shooter”. Subsequently Kotero recorded her own version of “Manic Monday”, but it would become a hit for the girl group The Bangles. Her voice is also heard on the Prince song “Take Me with U”. In 1985, she would leave Prince’s group to become part of the soap opera “Falcon Crest”, in which she performed several songs.</p><p>Three years later, Kotero signed a deal with Warner Bros. Records, and would release her solo album “Apollonia”. She then appeared in a string of films including “Black Magic Woman” and “Ministry of Vengeance”, and the Italian productions “Cattive Ragazze” and “La Donna di una Sera”. TV projects she appeared in include “Sliders”, “Air America”, and “MTV Cribs”.</p><p>In 2005, she formed Kotero Entertainment which aimed to produce various films and television shows. They would go on to manage young talent, including Nikki B. Four years later, Apollonia would record with The Twilight Singers on a cover of “When Doves Cry”.</p><p>For her personal life, it is known that Kotero was married to Greg Patschull from 1980-85, and then writer Kevin Bernhardt from 1987 to ’97.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table class=trademarks readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Deep sultry voice</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Natural black hair</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>3</td><td>Voluptuous bombshell figure</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=14><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=14><td>1</td><td>From Greek Apollon, which is of unknown meaning, though perhaps related to Indo-European *apelo "strength".

The Greeks later associated Apollon's name with the Greek verb apollymi meaning "to destroy". In Greek mythology Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto and the twin of Artemis. He is the god of prophecy, medicine, music, art, law, beauty, and wisdom.
