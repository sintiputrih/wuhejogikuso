Heat and humidity set the stage for our frizz to run wild, turning our perfectly quaffed mane into a sad, shapeless heap of hair. So how do we deal? On the one hand, we keep <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>humidity-proof styles</a> on speed dial. Of course, this only manages our frizz rather than actually treating and even preventing it from cropping up in the first place. To achieve the latter, we reached out to celebrity hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Jeremy Tardo</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Sam Villa</a>, co-founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Sam Villa</a> and global artistic ambassador for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5>Redken</a>, for their best summer haircare tips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep scrolling for how to treat frizzy hair in summer, according to your hair type and texture.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-flyaway-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Flyaway Hair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have flyaway-frizzy hair, it's important to assess the reason why, notes Tardo. "If the flyaway hair is caused by breakage, a strengthening hair treatment can help restore the strands," he says. "If your hair is dry, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>treatment masque</a> can help to repair the cuticle, restore moisture and help flyways lay flat."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Villa adds that keeping your hair compact when drying or applying heat, is another guaranteed way to reduce frizz and keep flyaways tamed. "I like to divide the hair into six or seven sections and braid each section tight," he says. The stylist then uses a straightening iron to go over each braid â€” gently closing the iron over the braid from root to end. "Follow the same technique on all braids and allow the hair to fully cool down before unraveling," he explains.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-damaged-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Damaged Hair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your hair has become dry or is generally in an unhealthy state, you've probably experienced summertime frizz. "With hair that is damaged, you really have to rely on specialty products to help repair the cuticle, tame frizz, and add shine," says Villa.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For my clients, I usually recommend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Redken's Acidic Bonding Concentrate</a> range." He says the three-step system of shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in infuses the hair with the intense conditioning that dry, damaged hair needs. To reap the most benefits from this treatment (read: super glossy strands) Villa recommends braiding your hair after putting in the final conditioner and then letting your hair completely dry before unwinding braids.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-natural-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Natural Hair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Natural curls soak up moisture and can expand with the summer heat very quickly. While gorgeously kinky, curly hair loves to be big, there may be times when you want to avoid expansion and reduce frizz. According to Villa, it's important to keep the curls compact and set them in place while the hair is damp. "You're basically locking in the curl pattern when you apply your product, so doing this on almost wet hair will lock in a smoother texture," he explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To help your curls stay refined, section your hair while damp and evenly distribute a smoothing product through the curls. Next, gather small sections and twist them tightly around your index finger, gradually twisting all your hair. "With your palms facing each other, enclose your hands around each section of curls and press firmly on your hair twice to compress it," says Villa. "Allow the hair to dry, and do not touch."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-all-hair-types></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>All Hair Types</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless of your hair type, there are a few simple tips that can help anyone keep frizz at bay.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Use a Silk Scarf</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Villa recommends setting your hair with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>silk scarf</a>. "Sleeping with your hair wrapped helps to reduce friction that causes frizz," explains the stylist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To set your hair, carve a center part from the front of your hairline to the nape. Lay the center of a scarf across the top of your head at the front parting. "Starting on one side of your head, wrap the hair around the scarf to reach the ends and tie into a loose bun," says Villa. "Repeat on the opposite side." Remove the scarf the next day and you're all set.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Try Plopping</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Believe it or not, the way you dry your hair can also contribute to frizz. "After shampooing your hair use a terry cloth towel or an old T-shirt to dry it off," says Tardo. This works because t-shirts do not have the rough grooves of a towel so the flat surface can absorb excess water and slide over the hair, instead of creating friction and frizz.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Pay Attention to Your Blowdrying Technique</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When smoothing frizzy hair with heat, be sure to direct the airflow of your blowdryer downward adds Tardo. "If the hair is blown in different directions, the cuticle will become rough, and the result will be more frizz."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs-59304c9e-979e-40ac-9a82-6d08bad53f65></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=47.644376899696><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What causes hair frizz? And why does it seem worse during the summer?</span></p><p>While certain hair types are naturally more prone to frizz than others, generally speaking, frizz occurs due to a lack of moisture in the hair. When your hair is dry, damaged, or chemically treated, the outer layer of the hair strand (the cuticle) becomes raised, as opposed to lying flat and smooth. During the summer, the hair often seeks moisture from the air around it, which is why humidity causes the hair to swell and turn frizzy.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=2 readability=-0.82729805013928><p><span class=accordion__title>Is a hair serum or a hair oil better at combating frizz?</span></p><p>Both can help to reduce frizz by lending moisture and beneficial nutrients to hair. To decide which hair serum and/or oil are right for you, consider your hair type and texture, as well as the active ingredients in the product.<br></p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=3 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Does hair length have an effect on frizz?</span></p><p>Hair length can affect frizz. With less weight, shorter styles are more prone to poofing out, especially if hair is curly or textured. Still, that doesn't mean that a short haircut isn't a good idea during summer. Just make sure to talk to your stylist about finding a cut that works with your hair type and texture. Incorporating long layers is one way to maintain your hair's shape with a shorter length.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZK%2Bmv9OlmKecXZ2uqr6Mn6CnoaOdtq%2BzjKyropubYq6urdmopQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
