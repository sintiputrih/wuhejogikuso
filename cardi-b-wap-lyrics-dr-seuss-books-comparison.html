Tim seemed to troll her by tweeting on Mar. 15, “The lyrics to ‘Wet Ass P***y’ are more welcome in some schools than Dr. Seuss books…just let that sink in for a minute.” Cardi let it sink it for far less than that, and came back swinging about how totally outrageous his claim was.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>When has a school made kids read the lyrics to wap?

How can ya not tell the difference? I see that common sense ain’t that common,” Cardi clapped back.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>She didn’t stop there with her schooling of Young! Cardi pointed out that the six Dr. Seuss books longer being published because of racist and insensitive imagery happened because of the late author <strong>Theodore Geisel</strong>‘s Dr. Seuss Enterprises choosing to protect his legacy, and not anyone banning the books. “By the way Dr Seuss publishing company made the decisions to remove those books on their own. Black people are not the one telling these companies to do things that they think is ‘progressive.’ Black only ask for equal justice,” Cardi continued in a second tweet.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>By the way Dr Seuss publishing company made the decisions to remove those books on their own .Black people are not the one telling these companies to do things that they think Is “progressive” black only ask for equal justice . <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>https://t.co/F34fphVBIb</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>— iamcardib (@iamcardib) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>March 15, 2021</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Conservatives been making viral tweets comparing WAP to the banning of some of Dr Seuss books as if there’s any correlations between the two ….Well I can DEFINITELY tell some of ya ONLY read dr Seuss books 🙄 cause ya mind lacks comprehension. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>https://t.co/F34fphVBIb</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>— iamcardib (@iamcardib) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>March 15, 2021</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Cardi then completely ended Tim, tweeting, “Conservatives been making viral tweets comparing WAP to the banning of some of Dr Seuss books as if there’s any correlations between the two….Well I can DEFINITELY tell some of ya ONLY read Dr. Seuss books cause ya mind lacks comprehension.” Bow down to this woman!&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cardi-B-Claps-Back-Wap-Welcome-In-Schools-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>Tim so far hasn’t responded to Cardi since she completely destroyed his comparison between the very adult song “WAP” — which was<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> never meant for kids</a> — with the racist illustrations in six of Dr. Seuss’ decades old children’s books. Some of the titles removed by his estate go so far back as 1937’s And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street and 1950’s If I Ran the Zoo.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is so true!!! My son told me that they replaced the PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE with this disgusting, profane "WAP" song (which is banned in my household).

One fan <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@leftjerkstore</a> put it very succinctly, responding “Sex is cool. Racism in books is not.” User <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@robsolonhamer</a> told Tim, “I too sometimes like to imagine things that aren’t actually happening to get good and panicked about a made-up moral outrage. Oh wait, no I don’t, because I’m a functioning adult.” Cardi’s fans were just as epic at shutting down Tim as she was!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH10e5BuZpyZopm2bq6MsJipZZyuv6qv0mabq2WjmsK0v4ybpqijo2KwsLnPmqmiq5%2BjfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
