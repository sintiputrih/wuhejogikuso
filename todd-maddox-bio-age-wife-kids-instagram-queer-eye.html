The award-winning show is back for season 6 and fans are excited about the return of the show. Along with the show, our Fab 5 Antoni Porowski, food and wine expert; Tan France, fashion expert; Karamo Brown, culture expert; Bobby Berk, design expert; and Jonathan Van Ness, grooming expert returned to change the lives of the participants on the show. But this time the show is based on the lone star state of Texas.</p><p>The first season of the show was released on 7 February 2018. The show is known for its strong representation amongst the LGBT&nbsp;community and communities that include&nbsp;people of color.</p><p>Along with Todd, the other nine heroes joining the show are; <a href=#>Terri</a>, <a href=#>Angel</a>, Josh, Navarro high prom, <a href=#>Jereka</a>, Jamie, Chris, Sarah, and <a href=#>Reggie</a>. So, the story of Todd is, he owned Plooky’s Cajun Boilin Pot, a Texan seafood establishment. He had started the business with his wife Jodie who died of a brain aneurysm ten years ago.</p><p>Kaci, his daughter, realized that her father wasn’t moving on so she nominated him to be on the show. Todd lost meaning to his life after losing his wife which was truly heartbreaking. Jonathan Van Ness and Tan France gave them makeovers. To the Fab 5’s surprise, he was willing to change upon the instructions.</p><p>Todd asked for his entire beard to be shaved off, much to JVN’s surprise, seeing that he was finally ready for that next time. Antoni assisted him in spicing up his gumbo recipe, which was the only thing missing from his menu, while Karamo Brown pushed him to return to his favorite pursuits, such as fishing.</p><p>They had a heartfelt discussion about loss and how to honor a loved one’s memory while still creating new ones. Bobby Berk, on the other hand, gave Plooky’s a complete facelift while paying tribute to Jodie. Kaci and Todd were both blown away by the changes and expressed their gratitude.</p><h3><strong>Todd Maddox Now</strong></h3><p>Todd Maddox was supposed to retire but he is still running his restaurant business Plookys Cajun Boiling Pot. He is scarcely active on social media. The business website shares that the business is still running. Google review states that back to two months ago, a Cheryl Sclafani added, “Anniversary dinner at Plooky’s was amazing, they stayed open later just so we could have a wonderful sit-down dinner and man did we eat!”</p><p>In the review, Cheryl further wrote, “We both had to work on our anniversary and this was an awesome way to end our day. Tod and Cameron made us feel like family and even gave us dessert to take home If you are in the canyon lake area check them out! It’s also BYOB”. Looks like Todd is keeping Jodie’s legacy alive!”</p><p>During the filming process, Todd did show some transformation. He agreed to start carving out time for some self-care. During the filming process, he was worried that if the ‘Queer Eye’ team did renovation work with his restaurant without his input, Jodie’s legacy or memory would be erased.</p><p>Then, Todd agreed to retire and give more responsibilities of the family business to his daughter Kaci. They hired 2 new employees. It was unclear just how much responsibility Kaci has assumed from her father, she seems to be looking forward to the future. Kaci wrote to her father, “I’ve never been more proud of you in my entire life, This is beautiful & we can’t wait to share our Season 6 journey with you all. We are proud to announce Toddles & Plookys are apart of the Queer Eye & Netflix family. Buckle up. It’s going to be a wild ride.”</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Todd Maddox?</strong></h3><p>As of January 2022, Todd Maddox should be 68 years old,</p><h3><strong>Todd Maddox Wife And Kids</strong></h3><p>Todd Maddox was married to his wife ‘Jodie’ Bonnie Lou Price.

She actively worked as a member and supporter of Canyon Lake.</p><p>‘Jodie’ was survived by her husband and kids; Chanel McNally of Phoenix City, Alabama, son-in-law Brian McNally and grandchildren Havyn Mica, Justice Mica, and Kennedy Lou McNally. Their daughter Kaci Maddox and future grandchild Atticus or Jodie.</p><p>Todd also has a daughter from his previous relationship; a daughter named Haley Maddox of San Antonio and granddaughter Brooklyn Maddox.
