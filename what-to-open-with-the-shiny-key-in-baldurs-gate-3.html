If it’s your first playthrough, you’ll also make a fool of yourself.</p><p data-injection=true>Act 1 had me glued to my screen, puzzled over how to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">squeeze into a tiny burrow</a> or locate the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">alchemist’s lab in the Blighted Village</a>. Eventually, I cracked all these brain-teasers, only to discover there were simpler shortcuts all along. Take the Shiny Key, for instance—sure, you’re thrilled about snatching it from those birdies, but the question lingers: where do you stick it? In this guide, I’ll reveal where to find and use the Shiny Key in&nbsp;BG3.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Is There a Baldur’s Gate 3 Cookbook?</a></p><h2>How to Find the Shiny Key in Baldur’s Gate 3</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shiny-Key-chest-bg3-2.jpg><p>You can find the Shiny Key in <strong>Act 1</strong> of&nbsp;Baldur’s Gate 3, just s<strong>outhwest of Druid Grove</strong>, on a <strong>bluejay nest</strong>.</p><p data-injection=true>Though you can just snatch the key carelessly, you’ll probably make some feathered enemies that way. Instead, switch to a sneaky character, like Astarion, and crouch as you walk up to the nest and snatch the Shiny Key in&nbsp;Baldur’s Gate 3.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shiny-Key-chest-bg3-3.jpg><p data-injection=true>There are also a bunch of alchemy materials nearby if you feel like stocking up on the Druid’s stash.

There are several ways to reach that Shiny Chest in the Druid Grove in&nbsp;Baldur’s Gate 3. Here are a couple of ideas:</p><ul data-injection=true><li>If <strong>Lae’zel</strong> is already at the party, just take advantage of her superb Githyanki athletics and <strong>jump </strong>to the pillar to use the Shiny Key on the chest in&nbsp;BG3.</li><li>If there’s a <strong>wizard</strong> or <strong>rogue </strong>on the party, or if you’ve got the required <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spell scroll</a>, cast <strong>Mage Hand</strong> and shove the Shiny Chest to the ground. Once it’s reachable, approach the Shiny Chest with your Shiny Key to open it.</li><li>If there’s a <strong>druid </strong>on the party or Halsin has already been recruited, use his <strong>Wild Shape</strong> action to transform into a Raven, fly up the pillar, and then shift back to human form. Now would be the time to open the Shiny Chest.</li></ul><p>I’m sure there are myriad other ways to open this chest; it would be&nbsp;Baldur’s Gate 3&nbsp;if it didn’t feel like a sandbox adventure game. Inside the Shiny Chest is <strong>224 Gold</strong>.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dd39bd735ebf6fbf05d2fe8f91a978f7?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Cande Maldonado</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Though Cande started her journey in the video game industry as a localization specialist six years ago, she soon realized that her true calling was to annoy NPCS, smash virtual pottery, and complete every side quest available in RPGs.
