In this weeklong quest for a greater understanding of Nancy — the deeper truths about her cinematic universe (the NMCU) and the sorts of comforts her audience seeks onscreen — I decided to reach out to the people who know her best: her collaborators. For the past two months I’ve been chatting with everyone from <a href=#>Diane Keaton</a> to <a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a> to Steve Martin to Hans Zimmer to Robert De Niro to discuss their impressions and memories of Nancy — as an artist, as a writer, as a director, as a friend — and, in the process, help explain what, exactly, makes her movies tick.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckit24xjq002y3g6fsvd5408g@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Part I: The Meet-Cutes</span></h2><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckit258ay003c3g6f6w2263lz@published>On first impressions of Nancy Meyers, the director.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ce3/482/9726205da4fc6c214b45032509f2cfbc99-nancy-meyers-on-set-02.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Nancy Meyers and Alec Baldwin on the set of It’s Complicated.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckit24n8r002r3g6f3xmbagha@published data-word-count=130><strong>Kimberly Williams-Paisley (Annie Banks in Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride Part II, and Father of the Bride 3ish):</strong> I was 19 years old, and had just flown out from Chicago to L.A. for the screen test for Father of the Bride. I remember after I read with Steve Martin and Diane Keaton, Nancy asked me to come outside so she could test my basketball skills. When I was done dribbling and shooting some baskets, she said, “You’ll hear from us sooner rather than later.” I found out later that was her way of saying I’d gotten the part. Once it was official, Nancy got on the phone with my mother and told her that during filming she would look after me as if I were her daughter.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckit3uyu2006n3g6fspb05dwf@published data-word-count=62><strong>Elaine Hendrix (Meredith Blake in The Parent Trap):</strong> Nancy and [her ex-husband] Charles [Shyer] have this interesting dynamic in that they’re parents and they’re true artists, so they have this creative, nurturing quality. But then they’re also so successful and totally business-oriented. It’s sort of like, “Oh, yeah.

She was the person who developed all their scripts. My <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-1 tabindex=0>partner</span> at the time and I were hired to take two scripts — one was called Senior Prom and the other High School — and they wanted us to make those two scripts into one movie. Which is preposterous, right? It was a three-day weekend, and they assigned Nancy to sit with us at Universal. It was like a ghost town: the guard and me, and Nancy, and my partner. And we actually did it. And Nancy became our third partner. I realized at that time how smart she was and how great she was as a collaborator. And also we started to fall for each other. She was so cute and so smart. She was the full package.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckit3uyu8006u3g6fdqfeei6t@published data-word-count=122><strong>Steve Martin (George Banks in Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride Part II, and Father of the Bride 3ish; Adam in It’s Complicated):</strong> I had signed up [to do], or was interested in doing, Father of the Bride. And the script, [Nancy and Charles] had not written it. It was a previously written draft. The writers, whose names I can’t remember, made it very contemporary, in the sense that the boyfriend rode a motorcycle and had tattoos and was crude, and the daughter was a rebel. Nancy and Charles came over and explained their vision of it, which couldn’t be more opposite of what the script was. But they have such confidence in their vision that you just go, “Sure.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckit3uyu8006v3g6frysge15h@published data-word-count=82><strong>Alec Baldwin (Jake Adler in It’s Complicated): </strong>When Nancy asked me to play Meryl [Streep]’s ex-husband [in It’s Complicated], one of my first observations was that Meryl is nine years older than me; therefore, was I the right person for the part? And in this meeting, Nancy told me that male stars cast women far younger than them all the time and no one bats an eye. What difference did it make in this case? And I realized how right she was.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckit3uyub006w3g6fz8s5km9i@published data-word-count=107><strong>Rene Russo (Fiona in The Intern): </strong>I really don’t love working. My first thing was, “What the fuck, you want me to read for [a part]?” So I went in to meet her and I was like, “Can we just, like, do this [audition] now? Can you just read this with me? Because I really don’t want to come back.” Not because of her. It’s just that, working for me is like, “Oh God, I can’t work again.” So she went, “You want me to read it right now?” I said, “Yeah, just read it with me.” She called in her assistant and we read it together.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckit6ufq300fi3g6f2u80g49i@published data-word-count=97>This is how incredibly thorough she is. I understood right off the bat that she does not hire anyone without reading them, except for I’m sure she didn’t read Meryl Streep. I actually said to my agent, “Hold on, she wants me to read for this part? She must’ve seen me in other movies!” Then when I went in there and talked to her, she’s great. She’s an easy laugh. So we read and it was fun in the room. Because I’m a reluctant actor a little bit, I think she was like, “Who is this crackpot?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckit3uyuc006x3g6ffdzw645e@published data-word-count=192><strong>Hans Zimmer (composer for Something’s Gotta Give, The Holiday, and It’s Complicated):</strong> I’ve met Nancy quite a few times before I started working with her because we had mutual friends in college. She always wanted me to work with her, and I kept thinking that there’s only so much comedy I can look at. I’m a German, how much comedy language do we have? And then she got very stuck one day. I’m not going to tell you which movie it was, but I’m writing this tune [for her]. The phone rings, and [Nancy] is already on her way. The tune is half finished, but they come in, so I have to play it. I hate playing in front of people. I’m really nervous. I play the thing much too fast, but she’s sitting at the side of the piano, so I can’t actually see her when I’m playing her this tune. I stop and I look at her and she’s crying. I’m going, That’s not good. She goes, “That’s not at all what I imagined for my movie.” I’m going, That’s double not good. And then she goes, “It’s really beautiful.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckit3uyue006y3g6fwy9z3rnl@published data-word-count=40><strong>Caitlin FitzGerald (Lauren Adler in It’s Complicated): </strong>I don’t remember my first impression of her exactly because I was blind with fear, but I suspect that even through the nerves I was aware that she was wearing something very chic.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckit3uyue006z3g6f1y6breo6@published data-word-count=44><strong>Andrew Rannells (Cameron in The Intern): </strong>I was very nervous to meet Nancy.

She cast us each completely separately, and then it wasn’t until later that someone’s like, “Oh, yeah, you hired the <a href=#>Workaholics</a> guys.” She’s like, “What?” I remember her being like, “I’ve got to watch your show.

But she has a way of making what she does pay off. She’s a stickler for her stuff, and sometimes I thought it was okay. I’ll keep going. It’s up to her to make that final decision.

I think Nancy has supreme confidence. I think she’s aware of her mastery, and she doesn’t apologize for it. She’s at the top for a reason, and she didn’t get there by apologizing for it. She didn’t get there by shrinking who she is.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckit4avvy008d3g6fn2xttgd6@published data-word-count=63><strong>Shannyn Sossamon (Maggie in The Holiday): </strong>I remember Jack [Black] was so stressed out [on the set of The Holiday] that at one point he just blurted out, in between setups, “I think I’m going to get fired.” It was really funny.

We made jokes on Father of the Bride 3ish. My daughter, who was 7, said, “How long did you try on sweatshirts for?” I said, “An hour.” The costume sessions for Father of the Bride were lengthy. It’d be a day. Jeans on, jeans off. “What about those jeans? What about these jeans? What about that T-shirt with these jeans?” So it’s exacting. And you know what? I appreciate that, because I kind of dress like Father of the Bride now. It’s kind of my look.

Nancy was like, “No, the sleeve is too long on that,” and, “I don’t know if I love that shoe.” She’s like that with everything! Including my hair and makeup. “No, it shouldn’t be so much. It should be this. I don’t want anything. Take off the lashes.” “I don’t have lashes, Nancy.” “Well, it looks like you have lashes.” I had never experienced that before. But you know, it was nothing that was annoying. It was like, you got why her films look the way they do.

Maybe even symmetrical. I don’t really grow as much facial hair on one side of my face as I do on the other. Nancy wasn’t super thrilled about that. So we had to glue matching fake-beard hair to one side of my face to make it look like a Hollywood beard. It paid off, because I looked great. And because of Nancy now, I just glue beard hair on myself all the time.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckit4jexl008s3g6f3kmwfp0n@published data-word-count=76><strong>Shyer:</strong> In Baby Boom, Nancy and Susan Becker really worked out that whole Diane Keaton look, with the belts. The style of Diane in that movie was a big deal; there is a lot of writing about it. Maybe she dresses a little like Diane, but Diane is so eccentric in the way she dresses.

There’s <a href=#>a scene [in Father of the Bride Part II] </a>where Steve Martin’s character takes sleeping pills and passes out, and then Franck drags him across the house. And I had wrapped [shooting], but I wanted to stick around and watch this. I remember being behind the monitor and [Nancy and Charles] were having so much fun, laughing really hard at Martin [Short] for dragging Steve Martin to the point where he [almost] just laid flat on the floor, with Steve Martin on top of his back. The whole point of it, it seemed, was just to have fun and make each other laugh.

They had all these different methods. And the thing they ended up doing was, they put a driver in the car, and dressed him as a car seat. I’m not even fucking kidding. They hollowed out a car seat and put it over him. He could barely see where he was going. And then I sat on his lap and put my hand on the steering wheel. He was looking over my shoulder through these tiny holes, barely able to see me, and driving and parking the car.

I was less concerned because I’d done characters, and I had found that in life, the world is populated with them. They just don’t know they’re comedic or that they’re characters. In other words, if Franck’s trying to be funny, then it will not be funny. So I remember the first thing that we tried, we started off larger than life. Then we kept turning down the dial, like a faucet, trying to get the right temperature in a bath.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckit4mz2f009c3g6ftdei4dn2@published data-word-count=94><strong>Baldwin: </strong>The obvious example of the strangest and silliest moment [on the set of It’s Complicated] was when we smoked pot in the bathroom, and I turned the joint around in my mouth to blow the smoke, shotgun style, at John Krasinski.

When we were doing Father of the Bride 3ish, I couldn’t believe how well-structured the script was. Especially because it’s essentially a Zoom movie. How she delayed characters’ entrances, so they’d have their own moment, just like you would in a movie. Nancy is what you call a perfectionist, and she has the line in her head the way it should sound. One time, Nancy came to me, and she said, “You read the lines exactly the way I hear them.” And I think that’s what she likes about my performance with her. The one person I’ve seen have permission to stray from that, or not have the conflict, is Diane Keaton, who reads every line differently every time.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckit4mz2s009h3g6fx1w6yrn5@published data-word-count=62><strong>Meyers-Shyer:</strong> My mom values comedy so much, and I think Diane’s ability to deliver my mom’s dialogue, it just makes her so happy.

So I rehearsed with the script supervisor, and I said, “Hey, I just have a question. What’s the feeling on set here? If I improvise something, are we good with that?” And she said, “No, you shouldn’t be improvising at all. You need to say them all as written.” And I was like, “Oh, okay. Well, if Meryl improvises something to me, am I allowed to then improvise back?” And she was like, “Meryl was improvising? I will go and tell her her lines.” I was like, “No, no, no. I’m not telling on Meryl!” I found out very quickly: That is not how Nancy rolls when it’s time to shoot. Nancy likes a firm respect and love of the words that she has penned, and <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-3 tabindex=0>I understand</span>.

We often get accused of being the “fancy house” guys. But specifically when we talk about Something’s Gotta Give, people remember the house in that movie because they connect emotionally with the story, period.

So I’m like, “I gotta try this.” And then I think I had seven spoons of burrata with a little dollop of olive oil on top of it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckit4w2ks00br3g6fuhk15xv2@published data-word-count=17><strong>Hathaway:</strong> Well, it was a guy Bob brought in.

I mean every single day. Everything about it was special from beginning to end, still 22 years later. It’s still special. And that’s the magic of Nancy Meyers. There’s an eternal hope in her movies — that life is going to be okay. I could cry right now. People, I think now more than ever, need to feel that everyone’s going to be okay.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckit4wwl500c03g6fnavc9blh@published data-word-count=97><strong>Kunz:</strong> I still occasionally get tweaked for being in The Parent Trap, and it’s often now by women who are probably in their 30s or are nearing menopause now. Those who remember it just glow with a love for it. If you think about it, the story’s kind of almost like a Greek tragedy. Your parents splitting up and taking a twin each and not telling them. I mean, think about it that way — it’s like, Jesus. But you kind of suspend your disbelief because of the kind of panache and chutzpah of the whole thing.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckit4wwl900c13g6f5c1u2vs9@published data-word-count=77><strong>DeVine:</strong> Every time I’m on a flight, I see people watching The Intern, and it makes me so happy. A few years ago, someone right next to me was watching The Intern, and when I’m onscreen, I lean over and go, “I love this scene.” The person looked at me like I was a lunatic.

What was immediately obvious to me in the work, when we were shooting and on set, was that there was a loving energy. Not to say that she wasn’t a leader, because she was. Mothers have to be leaders. But she took an interest in you as a human. “What’s your dating situation?” Once I called her because [I] had broken up with [someone] and I was heartbroken, and I was in tears. And she said, “Here’s what I want you to do. Go get a bottle of Champagne and pop it, because that guy was a loser.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckit4wwld00c83g6f4ikvuzqb@published data-word-count=131><strong>Zimmer:</strong> The thing is, Nancy comes into the room and you know it’s going to be excellent, whatever she does is going to be excellent, and you better live up to that. I love her style. I love that she tells grown-up stories. I always get the sense that at the end of the day, Nancy Meyers believes in <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-8 tabindex=0>true love</span>, and puts that on the screen. People are cynical, and people are ironic, and people are good at doing all those things. Well, Nancy actually wants to make a movie about something noble and honest and wonderful, and that thing called true love, and at the same time, let us celebrate it by having a laugh. I think Nancy would be really lousy at doing The Dark Knight or something.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckit4wwle00c93g6ftojooix6@published data-word-count=43><strong>Witherspoon: </strong>She continues to be an incredible resource to me.
