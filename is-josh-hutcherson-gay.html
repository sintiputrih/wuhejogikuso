Hutcherson’s romantic escapades have long captivated attention, often overshadowing his on-screen accomplishments and fueling endless speculation about his love life and relationships. Furthermore, his vocal support for the LGBTQ+ community has fueled curiosity, with more and more individuals gathering to question whether he himself is gay or otherwise. So, does he hold a place in the LGBTQ+ community?</p><h2 id=h-is-josh-hutcherson-straight-gay-or-bisexual data-injectable=false>Is Josh Hutcherson straight, gay, or bisexual?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FNAF-movie.jpg><p data-characters=528 data-current-count=828 data-injectable=true>Although the actor has never officially stated his sexual orientation as gay, Hutcherson has discussed his own sexual identity and how he has navigated not conforming to being “100 percent straight.” In an interview with the LGBTQ+ lifestyle <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">magazine Out</a>, he not only expressed unwavering support for the LGBTQ+ community by establishing the youth group Straight But Not Narrow, — which works to combat homophobia — but also revealed he doesn’t limit himself to the label of “straight.”</p><p>“I would probably list myself as mostly straight. Maybe I could say right now I’m 100% straight, but who knows? In a year, I could meet a guy and be like, ‘Whoa, I’m attracted to this person.’ I’ve met guys all the time that I’m like, ‘Damn, that’s a good-looking guy,’ you know?”</p><p data-characters=567 data-current-count=916 data-injectable=true>Furthermore, Hutcherson emphasized his firm belief that nobody is completely defined by any single aspect. He stated, “I’ve never been, like, ‘Oh, I want to kiss that guy.’ I really love women, but I think defining yourself as 100 percent anything is kind of near-sighted and close-minded.” During the same interview, he humorously suggested that his character Peeta would probably share his sentiments, even proposing that a romantic relationship involving Katniss, Peeta, and Gale could potentially resolve any conflicts the trio had.</p><p>“I know Peeta would be into it, for sure. He’s very sensitive, in touch with his emotions. I think it really might solve a lot of their problems. You know what? I’m going to pitch that idea. Let’s make it a—what’s it called when three people are in a relationship together? A triad?”</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true>As for his current romantic affairs, in 2014, the actor started seeing Spanish actress Claudia Traisac, whom he co-starred on the set of Escobar: Paradise Lost. From then on out, the duo has been absolutely inseparable, celebrating their decade-old romance this year. So, there you have it, Hutcherson may not be gay, but he’s probably the coolest human being around.</p><p data-characters=74 data-current-count=74 data-injectable=false>Five Nights at Freddy’s will start streaming on Peacock on Oct. 27.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnJqKqhZZiqwaS0xKuqqKZdnK66ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
