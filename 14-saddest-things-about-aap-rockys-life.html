Indeed, the star played just two songs before making a quick exit. But the dedication he made during his brief set explained why he couldn't carry on.</p><p>Just six days previously, close friend, mentor and A$AP Mob co-founder A$AP Yams, aka Steven Rodriguez, had passed away. And Rocky told <a href=#>Billboard</a> that he was still in mourning when he took to the stage: "That performance â€” that was just going to stop me from crying. I had to address it, because the whole time I was rapping and I wasn't into it, which is sad, but I just gotta keep it real. I can't front."</p><p>Referring to the impending funeral, Rocky added, "It's even harder knowing that I gotta fly out in less than an hour just to go bury him. That's the part that eats at me." But the star, who also had to attend&nbsp;Paris Fashion Week in the wake of Yams' death, insisted that he would get back in his zone soon: "It's all about good people with good energy, and the universe keeps producing them to me. I'll be fine. God is good and I keep all hope and faith."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamphZ31xgY5qa2arkZmxpr%2FTZquhoZ6cwG6twaisrWWRlr1uvs6corKrXaG2p7GO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
